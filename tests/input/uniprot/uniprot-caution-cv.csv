TERM,DEFINITION,EXAMPLES
FUNCTION_DISPUTED,A caution indicating that a previously reported function has been challenged or disproven in subsequent studies; may warrant GO NOT annotation,"Originally described for its in vitro hydrolytic activity towards dGMP, dAMP and dIMP. However, this was not confirmed in vivo"
FUNCTION_PREDICTION_ONLY,A caution indicating function is based only on computational prediction or sequence similarity,Predicted to be involved in X based on sequence similarity
FUNCTION_LACKS_EVIDENCE,A caution indicating insufficient experimental evidence to support predicted function,"In contrast to other Macro-domain containing proteins, lacks ADP-ribose glycohydrolase activity"
FUNCTION_DEBATED,A caution about ongoing scientific debate regarding function; differs from DISPUTED in lacking clear evidence against,"Was initially thought to act as a major regulator of cardiac hypertrophy... However, while PDE5A regulates nitric-oxide-generated cGMP, nitric oxide signaling is often depressed by heart disease, limiting its effect"
LOCALIZATION_DISPUTED,A caution about conflicting or uncertain cellular localization evidence,"Cellular localization remains to be finally defined. While most authors have deduced a localization at the basolateral side, other studies demonstrated an apical localization"
NAMING_CONFUSION,A caution about potential confusion with similarly named proteins or historical naming issues,"This protein should not be confused with the conventional myosin-1 (MYH1);Was termed importin alpha-4"
GENE_COPY_NUMBER,A caution about gene duplication or copy number that might affect interpretation,"Maps to a duplicated region on chromosome 15; the gene is present in at least 3 almost identical copies"
EXPRESSION_MECHANISM_UNCLEAR,A caution about unclear or unusual mechanisms of gene expression or protein production,"This peptide has been shown to be biologically active but is the product of a mitochondrial gene. The mechanisms allowing the production and secretion of the peptide remain unclear"
SEQUENCE_FEATURE_MISSING,A caution about missing or unexpected sequence features that might affect function,"No predictable signal peptide"
SPECIES_DIFFERENCE,A caution about significant functional or property differences between orthologs,"Affinity and capacity of the transporter for endogenous substrates vary among orthologs. For endogenous compounds such as dopamine, histamine, serotonin and thiamine, mouse ortholog display higher affinity"
PUBLICATION_CONFLICT,A caution about conflicting published evidence or interpretation,"Although initially reported to transport carnitine across the hepatocyte membrane, another study was unable to verify this finding"
CLAIMS_RETRACTED,A caution about function claims that were retracted or withdrawn,"Has been reported to enhance netrin-induced phosphorylation of PAK1 and FYN... This article has been withdrawn by the authors"
PROTEIN_IDENTITY,A caution about uncertainty in the identity or existence of distinct protein products,"It is not known whether the so-called human ASE1 and human CAST proteins represent two sides of a single gene product"
FUNCTION_UNCERTAIN_INITIATION,A caution about uncertainty in translation initiation site,"It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-37 is the initiator"
PSEUDOGENE_STATUS,A caution about whether the gene encodes a protein,"Could be the product of a pseudogene"
