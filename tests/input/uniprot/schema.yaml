    permissible_values:
      FUNCTION_DISPUTED:
        description: A caution indicating that a previously reported function has been challenged or disproven in subsequent studies; may warrant GO NOT annotation
        examples:
          - value: FUNCTION_DISPUTED
            description: "Originally described for its in vitro hydrolytic activity towards dGMP, dAMP and dIMP. However, this was not confirmed in vivo"

      FUNCTION_PREDICTION_ONLY:
        description: A caution indicating function is based only on computational prediction or sequence similarity
        examples:
          - value: FUNCTION_PREDICTION_ONLY
            description: "Predicted to be involved in X based on sequence similarity"

      FUNCTION_LACKS_EVIDENCE:
        description: A caution indicating insufficient experimental evidence to support predicted function
        examples:
          - value: FUNCTION_LACKS_EVIDENCE
            description: "In contrast to other Macro-domain containing proteins, lacks ADP-ribose glycohydrolase activity"

      FUNCTION_DEBATED:
        description: A caution about ongoing scientific debate regarding function; differs from DISPUTED in lacking clear evidence against
        examples:
          - value: FUNCTION_DEBATED
            description: "Was initially thought to act as a major regulator of cardiac hypertrophy... However, while PDE5A regulates nitric-oxide-generated cGMP, nitric oxide signaling is often depressed by heart disease, limiting its effect"

      LOCALIZATION_DISPUTED:
        description: A caution about conflicting or uncertain cellular localization evidence
        examples:
          - value: LOCALIZATION_DISPUTED
            description: "Cellular localization remains to be finally defined. While most authors have deduced a localization at the basolateral side, other studies demonstrated an apical localization"

      NAMING_CONFUSION:
        description: A caution about potential confusion with similarly named proteins or historical naming issues
        examples:
          - value: NAMING_CONFUSION
            description: "This protein should not be confused with the conventional myosin-1 (MYH1);Was termed importin alpha-4"

      GENE_COPY_NUMBER:
        description: A caution about gene duplication or copy number that might affect interpretation
        examples:
          - value: GENE_COPY_NUMBER
            description: "Maps to a duplicated region on chromosome 15; the gene is present in at least 3 almost identical copies"

      EXPRESSION_MECHANISM_UNCLEAR:
        description: A caution about unclear or unusual mechanisms of gene expression or protein production
        examples:
          - value: EXPRESSION_MECHANISM_UNCLEAR
            description: "This peptide has been shown to be biologically active but is the product of a mitochondrial gene. The mechanisms allowing the production and secretion of the peptide remain unclear"

      SEQUENCE_FEATURE_MISSING:
        description: A caution about missing or unexpected sequence features that might affect function
        examples:
          - value: SEQUENCE_FEATURE_MISSING
            description: "No predictable signal peptide"

      SPECIES_DIFFERENCE:
        description: A caution about significant functional or property differences between orthologs
        examples:
          - value: SPECIES_DIFFERENCE
            description: "Affinity and capacity of the transporter for endogenous substrates vary among orthologs. For endogenous compounds such as dopamine, histamine, serotonin and thiamine, mouse ortholog display higher affinity"

      PUBLICATION_CONFLICT:
        description: A caution about conflicting published evidence or interpretation
        examples:
          - value: PUBLICATION_CONFLICT
            description: "Although initially reported to transport carnitine across the hepatocyte membrane, another study was unable to verify this finding"
            
      CLAIMS_RETRACTED:
        description: A caution about function claims that were retracted or withdrawn
        examples:
          - value: CLAIMS_RETRACTED
            description: "Has been reported to enhance netrin-induced phosphorylation of PAK1 and FYN... This article has been withdrawn by the authors"

      PROTEIN_IDENTITY:
        description: A caution about uncertainty in the identity or existence of distinct protein products
        examples:
          - value: PROTEIN_IDENTITY
            description: "It is not known whether the so-called human ASE1 and human CAST proteins represent two sides of a single gene product"

      FUNCTION_UNCERTAIN_INITIATION:
        description: A caution about uncertainty in translation initiation site
        examples:
          - value: FUNCTION_UNCERTAIN_INITIATION
            description: "It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-37 is the initiator"

      PSEUDOGENE_STATUS:
        description: A caution about whether the gene encodes a protein
        examples:
          - value: PSEUDOGENE_STATUS
            description: "Could be the product of a pseudogene"
