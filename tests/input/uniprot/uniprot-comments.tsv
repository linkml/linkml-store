MOTSC_HUMAN		This peptide has been shown to be biologically active but is the product of a mitochondrial gene. Usage of the mitochondrial genetic code yields tandem start and stop codons so translation must occur in the cytoplasm. The mechanisms allowing the production and secretion of the peptide remain unclear
POTB3_HUMAN		Maps to a duplicated region on chromosome 15; the gene is present in at least 3 almost identical copies
MYO1C_HUMAN		Represents an unconventional myosin. This protein should not be confused with the conventional myosin-1 (MYH1)
IMA4_HUMAN		Was termed importin alpha-4
S22A1_HUMAN		Cellular localization of OCT1 in the intestine and the kidney remains to be finally defined. While most authors have deduced a localization at the basolateral side of enterocytes consistent with a physiological role in organic anions uptake from the blood flow and intestinal excretion (PubMed:16263091), other studies demonstrated an apical localization (PubMed:23680637), supporting a function in intestinal absorption of organic anions and drugs (PubMed:16263091, PubMed:23680637). Similarly, contradictory results localized the transporter to the basolateral side (By similarity) or to the apical side (PubMed:19536068) of proximal tubules (By similarity) (PubMed:19536068). Although initially reported to transport carnitine across the hepatocyte membrane (PubMed:28942964), another study was unable to verify this finding (PubMed:28942964, PubMed:34040533). Affinity and capacity of the transporter for endogenous substrates vary among orthologs (PubMed:16581093, PubMed:34040533, PubMed:35469921). For endogenous compounds such as dopamine, histamine, serotonin and thiamine, mouse ortholog display higher affinity and capacity compared with human OCT1 (PubMed:35469921). In contrast with mouse ortholog, not able to transport carnitine, noradrenaline and choline (PubMed:34040533)
RPA34_HUMAN		It is not known whether the so-called human ASE1 and human CAST proteins represent two sides of a single gene product with sharply different functional characteristics. Experiments done with the mouse homolog protein are in favor of an implication of this gene in rRNA transcription instead of T-cell receptor signaling
ENK18_HUMAN		No predictable signal peptide
DNPH1_HUMAN		Originally described for its in vitro hydrolytic activity towards dGMP, dAMP and dIMP (PubMed:24260472, PubMed:25108359). However, this was not confirmed in vivo (PubMed:33833118)
PM34_HUMAN		Was first identified as a peroxisomal ATP transporter (PubMed:12445829). However, later experiments showed that it acts as a peroxisomal transporter for multiple cofactors (PubMed:22185573)
SAHH2_HUMAN		In spite of its similarity with AHCY, which catalyzes the reversible hydrolysis of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine to adenosine and homocysteine, recombinant AHCYL1 expressed in bacteria shows no hydrolase activity, nor does it affect the enzyme activity of AHCY
MAST3_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1, Met-171 or Met-172 is the initiator
DSCAM_HUMAN		Has been reported to enhance netrin-induced phosphorylation of PAK1 and FYN; and the interaction between DSCAM, PAK1 and RAC1 has been described. This article has been withdrawn by the authors
OGA_HUMAN		The mouse and rat orthologs were initially identified as bi-functional proteins containing an N-terminal domain with O-GlcNAcase activity and a C-terminal domain with histone acetyltransferase activity. The histone acetyltransferase activity was detected only when the protein was expressed in mammalian cells, but not when expressed in bacterial cells, suggesting that the histone acetyltransferase activity might be due to the presence of a contaminant. Comparison of the human protein with a bacterial putative acetyltransferase (AC Q2CEE2) shows that the residues important for acetyl-CoA binding are not conserved, and that the residues proposed to be important for histone acetyltransferase activity are not in a position where they could participate in catalysis. Characterization of the human protein shows that it does not bind acetyl-CoA and therefore cannot have acetyltransferase activity
FCMR_HUMAN		Initially it was identified as a potent inhibitor of FAS-induced apoptosis. The findings were latter disputed by other groups and it was shown to have no intrinsic activity inhibiting FAS-mediated apoptosis
PHF2_HUMAN		In contrast to the related histone demethylases JHDM1D and PHF8, the conserved active His in position 321 is replaced by a Tyr. However, the presence of a Tyr residue neither affects binding to the catalytic iron nor abolishes demethylase activity (PubMed:21167174)
CILP1_HUMAN		Was originally thought to constitute the ATP pyrophosphatase enzyme (NTPPH). However, it was later shown (PubMed:12746903, PubMed:15864306) that it is not the case
FKBP6_HUMAN		Although it contains a PPIase FKBP-type domain, does not show peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity
H2AY_HUMAN		In contrast to other Macro-domain containing proteins, lacks ADP-ribose glycohydrolase activity
MTU1_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a 5-methylaminomethyl-2-methyltransferase involved in tRNA modification
BCAR3_HUMAN		The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity is controversial. One study showed GEF activity towards RALA, RAP1A and RRAS (By similarity). However, in another study, a construct containing only the Ras-GEF domain lacks GEF activity towards RAP1 (PubMed:22081014)
CBR3_HUMAN		There are conflicting results on the ability of CBR3 to metabolize menadione. Although menadione was originally reported as a good substrate of CBR3 (PubMed:15537833), results of later studies showed that CBR3 possesses very low or no activity toward menadione (PubMed:18493841, PubMed:19841672)
ATRN_HUMAN		Was originally (PubMed:7539799, PubMed:9736737) thought to have dipeptidase activity but it was shown later to lack that activity
CDKL5_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-10 is the initiator
PDE5A_HUMAN		Was initially thought to act as a major regulator of cardiac hypertrophy in myocytes and muscle and investigations have been made on selective PDE5A inhibitors that could protect against cardiovascular disease. However, while PDE5A regulates nitric-oxide-generated cGMP, nitric oxide signaling is often depressed by heart disease, limiting its effect. Moreover, clinical trial using PDE5A inhibitors were disappointing
RIMB1_HUMAN		PubMed:9915832 demonstrated interaction with TSPO but later PubMed:12435798 demonstrated in the rat ortholog that is not associated with TSPO in the brain
MTMR5_HUMAN		Although it belongs to the non-receptor class myotubularin subfamily, lacks the conserved active site cysteine residue at position 1422 in the dsPTPase catalytic loop and does not have phosphatase activity (PubMed:9537414). The pocket is however sufficiently preserved to bind phosphorylated substrates, and maybe protect them from phosphatases
ATE1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-37 is the initiator
FRITZ_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-34 is the initiator
AACT_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-4 is the initiator

MAS_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a receptor for angiotensin II
VIME_HUMAN		Was reported to interact with SLC6A4, however the paper was retracted as some results and conclusions are not reliable
UCHL1_HUMAN		PubMed:9774100 reports the association of mutation Ile93Met with Parkinson disease. However, according to PubMed:16450370 this association is uncertain and UCHL1 is not a susceptibility gene for Parkinson disease
UCHL1_HUMAN		The oxidation forms of Met-1, Met-6, Met-12, Met-124, Met-179 and Cys-220 are subject of controversy and could be the artifactual results of sample handling
UCHL1_HUMAN		The homodimer may have ATP-independent ubiquitin ligase activity (PubMed:12408865). However, in another study, UCHL1 was shown to lack ubiquitin ligase activity (PubMed:23359680)
JMJD7_HUMAN		This sequence was first thought to be an alternatively spliced isoform of PLA2G4B. It is derived from JMJD7 which is located upstream of PLA2G4B. Most tissues also express read-through transcripts from JMJD7 into the downstream PLA2G4B gene, some of which may encode fusion proteins combining the N-terminus of this protein with PLA2G4B protein
NARR_HUMAN		Shares its exons with RAB34, but the first 5'-exon is longer, and the translation occurs 443 base pairs upstream from RAB34 initiator, in another frame. May be produced by an alternative promoter
RPAC2_HUMAN		Contrary to isoform 2, isoform 1 contains an RNA polymerase domain and has DNA-dependent RNA polymerase function. Synteny studies in vertebrates suggest that this isoform has been created by a mammalian-specific retrotransposition event of an ancestral gene which has been lost later on in this lineage
RARA_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be part of the MLL5-L complex, at least composed of KMT2E, STK38, PPP1CA, PPP1CB, PPP1CC, HCFC1, ACTB and OGT (PubMed:19377461). However, the corresponding article has been retracted (PubMed:24336203)
CP2C8_HUMAN		Alternative splicing has been shown to occur but the shorter forms are believed to be non-functional
CLUS_HUMAN		Isoform 4 has been previously detected in cytosol and in the nuclei of apoptotic cells and promoted apoptosis following irradiation (PubMed:12551933). However the nuclear localization and apoptosis promotion has not been confirmed in other cell types (PubMed:24073260)
MYH3_HUMAN		Represents a conventional myosin. This protein should not be confused with the unconventional myosin-3 (MYO3)
MYH3_HUMAN		Variants Ala-1622 and Val-1637 have been originally reported as DA2B3 pathogenic mutations (PubMed:16642020). These variants are now thought to be polymorphisms on the basis of additional family information and frequencies in large databases of control populations (PubMed:25957469)
ERF3A_HUMAN		eRF3 antibodies used in PubMed:19417104 do not differentiate between GSPT1/ERF3A and GSPT2/ERF3B
MUC1_HUMAN		O-glycosylation sites are annotated in first sequence repeat only. Residues at similar position are probably glycosylated in all repeats. Experimental sites were determined in a synthetic peptide glycosylated in vitro (PubMed:7744025, PubMed:9597769)
GCFC2_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a DNA-binding transcriptional repressor. However, later work showed that the original sequence was a chimera and that the DNA-binding activity was derived from the incorrect N-terminal sequence
CBPE_HUMAN		Isoform 2 was reported to be located in the nucleus and to interact with HDAC1 and HDAC2 (PubMed:21285511). However, this work was later retracted (PubMed:30882370)
ASM_HUMAN		Variants Gln-294 and Val-485 have been originally reported as disease-causing mutations in NPDA and NPDB (PubMed:12369017, PubMed:15221801). These variants have been reclassified as benign polymorphisms (PubMed:23430512)
TYRP1_HUMAN		The precise function of this protein in melanin biosynthesis is still under debate. DHICA oxidase activity is controversial (PubMed:28661582, PubMed:9758418). Lacks DHICA oxidase activity (PubMed:9758418). Has DHICA oxidase activity in the presence of Cu(2+), but lacks DHICA oxidase activity with Zn(2+) (PubMed:28661582)
ARY1_HUMAN		The allelic variation Ile-149 designated as NAT1*17 is part of the NAT1*11 allelic variation as reported by the nomenclature committee
HXK1_HUMAN		Hexokinase is known to act as a monomer (PubMed:10686099). It however homodimerizes at elevated protein concentrations used for crystallizations (PubMed:10574795, PubMed:9493266)
SL9A1_HUMAN		Although PubMed:12809501 report that TESC-binding results in a decrease in activity, studies with rat SLC9A1 show that TESC-binding results in the maturation and accumulation of SLC9A1 at the cell surface
SL9A1_HUMAN		The interacting region with TESC is conflicting: Interaction with TESC has been reported via the juxtamembrane region of the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain, including residues 503-545 (PubMed:11696366, PubMed:30287853). In contrast, another publication has reported interaction with TESC via residues 633-815, the region of the cytoplasmic C-terminus more distal to the membrane (PubMed:12809501)
RAB4A_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-6 is the initiator
CD11B_HUMAN		Many references talk about 'p110 isoforms' but it is not yet known if this refers to CDK11A and/or CDK11B or one/some of the isoforms of each
ENDOU_HUMAN		Was originally (PubMed:2350438) thought to be a serine protease. However, PubMed:18936097 showed it is not the case
NF1_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be associated with LEOPARD (LS), an autosomal dominant syndrome
TGM2_HUMAN		Initial enzymatic assays were performed with a protein sequence containing a Gly residue instead of a Val at position 224: such protein displays lower Ca(2+)-binding affinity and reduced transglutaminase activity
TENX_HUMAN		There are two genes for TN-X: TNXA and TNXB. TNXA can sometimes recombine with TNXB
FGFR4_HUMAN		An additional N-terminally truncated cytoplasmic isoform was previously reported to exist. However, the paper was subsequently retracted due to concerns regarding duplication of panels in some figures
CCNO_HUMAN		Was originally thought to have uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) activity and wrongly named UNG2 and UDG2 (PubMed:2001396). It was later shown that it is a member of the cyclin family (PubMed:8419333). UNG2 corresponds to the isoform 2 of UNG gene
HV102_HUMAN		For examples of full-length immunoglobulin heavy chains (of different isotypes) see AC P0DOX2, AC P0DOX3, AC P0DOX4, AC P0DOX5 and AC P0DOX6
ACKR3_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be the receptor for VIP
KAD4_HUMAN		Some studies have failed to detect adenylate kinase activity (PubMed:11485571, PubMed:19130895). However, kinase activity has been demonstrated in a number of other studies (PubMed:19766732, PubMed:23416111)
TEAD1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-16 is the initiator
MSX1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-7 is the initiator
S10A2_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-2 is the initiator
SC6A4_HUMAN		Was reported to interact with VIM, however the paper was retracted as some results and conclusions are not reliable
SC6A4_HUMAN		Was reported to interact with RAB4 and to be induced by serotonin, however the paper was retracted as some results and conclusions are not reliable
CH3L1_HUMAN		Although it belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 18 family, Leu-140 is present instead of the conserved Glu which is an active site residue. Therefore this protein lacks chitinase activity
GMPR1_HUMAN		The N-terminus was initially (PubMed:2758468) thought to be fused with glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) protein in vivo. However, PubMed:2570640 showed that it encodes a GMP reductase, and PubMed:1694726 showed that the chimeric protein is an artifact
CAPG_HUMAN		This protein was originally thought to be a DNA-binding protein with a helix-loop-helix domain
TXLNA_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a high molecular weight interleukin (IL-14 or IL14)
SOX3_HUMAN		Was originally termed SOX-9
STAT1_HUMAN		Has been shown to be mono-ADP-ribosylated at Glu-657 and Glu-705 by PARP14 which prevents phosphorylation at Tyr-701 (PubMed:27796300). However, the role of ADP-ribosylation in the prevention of phosphorylation has been called into question (PubMed:29858569). It has been suggested that the lack of phosphorylation may be due to sumoylation of Lys-703 (PubMed:29858569)
EPS15_HUMAN		Studies in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of ITGB1 and TFR used a siRNA mixture of EPS15 and EPS15L1, and a Dab2 mutant with impaired binding to EH domain-containing proteins EPS15 and ITSN1 suggesting a partially overlapping role of the EH domain-containing proteins
TEC_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 is the initiator
CBX5_HUMAN		Was previously reported to interact with ASXL1. However, this publication has been retracted
GPR3_HUMAN		Was originally (PubMed:12220620) thought to be a receptor for sphingosine 1-phosphate. PubMed:19286662 demonstrated that it is not the case
KC1D_HUMAN		Was shown to phosphorylate and activate DCK in vitro but probably not in vivo
STK19_HUMAN		There is a discrepancy about the expression of this isoform (PubMed:30712867, PubMed:32531245). At protein level, Rodriguez-Martinez et al. shows that isoform 1 is not expressed in melanocyte cells lines and two commonly used human cell lines (HEK293 and HeLa) (PubMed:32531245). According to Yin et al. isoform 1 is expressed, at very low level, in melanocyte cells lines and human primary melanocytes (PubMed:30712867)
STK19_HUMAN		Originally found as a serine/threonine-protein kinase that phosphorylates CSN1S1/alpha-casein at serine/threonine residues, histones at serine residues (PubMed:9812991) and NRAS at serine residues (PubMed:30712867, PubMed:9812991). According to a recent study, it is inactive (PubMed:32531245, PubMed:32531246)
MCSP_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a selenoprotein and was known as sperm mitochondrial capsule selenoprotein
HXK2_HUMAN		Hexokinase is known to act as a monomer in normal conditions (By similarity). It however homodimerizes at elevated protein concentrations used for crystallizations (PubMed:26985301, PubMed:29298880)
ANAG_HUMAN		A MPS3B mutation at position 100 was erroneously reported (PubMed:9950362) as an amino acid change from Arg to His. The right amino acid change is from His to Arg
SLUR1_HUMAN		It is not certain that ARS and ANUP are identical proteins
TERA_HUMAN		It is unclear how it participates in the recruitment of TP53BP1 at DNA damage sites. According to a first report, participates in the recruitment of TP53BP1 by promoting ubiquitination and removal of L3MBTL1 from DNA damage sites (PubMed:22120668). According to a second report, it acts by removing 'Lys-48'-linked ubiquitination from sites of DNA damage (PubMed:22020440)
GP2_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-8 is the initiator
CORO7_HUMAN		Reported to form a E3 ubiquitin-ligase complex and promote degradation of TOB1 (PubMed:21130766). Additional evidence is however required to confirm these data
ATS12_HUMAN		Was reported to be expressed in adult skeletal muscle and fat, in fetal lung, and in gastric carcinomas and cancer cells of diverse origin (PubMed:11279086). However, this paper has been retracted because data in one figure has been falsified (PubMed:30808000)
1433Z_HUMAN		Was originally thought to have phospholipase A2 activity
POK9_HUMAN		Truncated; frameshift leads to premature stop codon
UB2L3_HUMAN		PubMed:10760570 reported that UBE2L1, UBE2L2 and UBE2L4 are most likely pseudogenes and the only expressed member of this subfamily seems to be UBE2L3
CBX1_HUMAN		Was previously reported to interact with ASXL1. However, this publication has been retracted
H33_HUMAN		The original paper reporting lysine deamination at Lys-5 by LOXL2 has been retracted due to inappropriate manipulation of figure data (PubMed:22483618, PubMed:27392148). However, this modification was confirmed in a subsequent publication (PubMed:27735137)
RELB_HUMAN		Was originally thought to inhibit the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor NF-kappa-B
OCRL_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1, Met-18 or Met-20 is the initiator
ROR2_HUMAN		The catalytic activity of the kinase domain is controversial
AK17A_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a cell surface protein involved in B-cell activation
RHAG_HUMAN		Several mechanisms of transport has been proposed, namely electroneutral NH3 transport (PubMed:15572441, PubMed:19273840) and electroneutral NH4(+)/H(+) exchange (PubMed:11861637, PubMed:15572441, PubMed:19273840). However, Caner T. et al demonstrates that RHAG is unlikely to be NH4(+)/H(+) exchanger, but transports the ionic NH4(+) and the neutral NH3 species and that the transport of NH4(+) is electrogenic (PubMed:26354748)
HGFA_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 is the initiator
DDR1_HUMAN		The mutant Gln-371 studied is still likely to be glycosylated at Asn-370, but study did not include mutagenesis of Asn-370
ELP6_HUMAN		The elongator complex was originally thought to play a role in transcription elongation. However, it is no longer thought to play a direct role in this process and its primary function is thought to be in tRNA modification
U17LO_HUMAN		The RS447 megasatellite DNA is a highly polymorphic conserved tandem repetitive sequence which contains a copy of the USP17 gene. It is present with an interindividual variation in copy number, ranging from 20 to 103, and can be found in the genome both on chromosome 4 and chromosome 8. The high similarity between the UPS17-like genes makes impossible to clearly assign data to one of the genes of the family. Oligonucleotides designed in RNAi experiments are for instance not specific of a given UPS17-like gene
NU160_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-35 is the initiator
MYO1E_HUMAN		Represents an unconventional myosin. This protein should not be confused with the conventional myosin-1 (MYH1)
STK4_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be phosphorylated at Thr-120 (PubMed:19940129). However, this work has been retracted (PubMed:27825096)
CAF1A_HUMAN		Was reported to form, during DNA replication, a S phase-specific complex that would facilitate methylation of H3 'Lys-9' during replication-coupled chromatin assembly and vould be at least composed of the CAF-1 subunit CHAF1A, MBD1 and SETDB1 (PubMed:15327775). However, this paper has been retracted because some data, results and conclusions are not reliable (PubMed:30849389)
ERCC8_HUMAN		PMID:16916636 was retracted due to image manipulations
MYO9B_HUMAN		Represents an unconventional myosin. This protein should not be confused with the conventional myosin-9 (MYH9)
NBR1_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be the ovarian carcinoma antigen CA125
STAR3_HUMAN		STARD3 was reported to function in cholesterol transport to the mitochondria or to the cell membrane (PubMed:12070139, PubMed:19965586). Other reports however showed that it mediates cholesterol transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to endosomes (PubMed:11053434, PubMed:28377464). Discrepancies may be due to the different cell type used and the cellular physiological state (PubMed:28377464)
EXOS7_HUMAN		The six exosome core subunits containing a RNase PH-domain are not phosphorolytically active
OASL_HUMAN		This is the ortholog of mouse OASL1
ITSN1_HUMAN		Studies in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of ITGB1 and TFR used a siRNA mixture of ISTN1 and ISTN2, and a Dab2 mutant with impaired binding to EH domain-containing proteins EPS15 and ITSN1 suggesting a partially overlapping role of the EH domain-containing proteins
ADIPO_HUMAN		The expected hydroxylation of Lys-33 was not identified, probably due to poor representation of the N-terminal peptide in mass fingerprinting
LAMA4_HUMAN		Gene LAMA4 was formerly called LAMA3
TAF9_HUMAN		AK6 and TAF9 were initially considered as products of the same gene since they share two exons. However, they are translated from different initiation codons and reading frames and encode unrelated proteins. This arrangement is conserved in some mammalian species
PTPRN_HUMAN		Does not possess catalytic activity due to replacement of highly conserved residues in tyrosine-protein phosphatase domain
CL16A_HUMAN		Despite its name, does not contain a C-type lectin domain
WASC4_HUMAN		One study reported a nucleation-promoting factor (NPF) activity towards the Arp2/3 complex using partially purified samples of the WASH complex (PubMed:19922875). In another study, the in vitro reconstituted and purified recombinant WASH core complex, consisting of WASHC3, WASHC4, WASHC5, WASHC1 and the N-terminal residues 1-356 of WASHC2, did not show activity toward Arp2/3 complex (PubMed:20498093)
DRB5_HUMAN		HLA-DRB3, HLA-DRB4 and HLA-DRB5 may represent a unique gene
RHGBB_HUMAN		Although it contains a Rho-GAP domains, does not have GTPase activator activity (PubMed:25721503, PubMed:27957544). The absence of GTPase activator activity is required to promote amplification of basal progenitors (PubMed:27957544). Restoring this activity abolishes ability to promote amplification of basal progenitors during neocortex development (PubMed:27957544)
SL9C1_HUMAN		The transport mechanisms that drive proton efflux in sperm appear to be species-specific. While sea urchin SLC9C1 ortholog functions as a voltage-gated and cAMP-sensitive sodium:proton exchanger that dominantly regulates proton efflux in sperm, no such transporter activity is observed for human SLC9C1. Consistently, functionally conserved residues in the transport, voltage sensor and cyclic nucleotide-binding domains present in sea urchin SLC9C1 are missing in mammalian SLC9C1, suggesting alternative transport mechanisms between species. The transport activity of SLC9C1 remains to be elucidated
ACSM3_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-9 is the initiator
APRV1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-85 is the initiator
BOLA3_HUMAN		Was initially reported to be secreted via a non-classical export pathway (PubMed:18548201). It was however later shown that it localizes to mitochondria, in agreement with other members of the family (PubMed:22746225)
PYDC2_HUMAN		Absent from the genome of domestic mammals and New World monkeys it is found in the genome of hominids and Old World monkeys. Likely derived from retrogene insertion of an NLRP2/NLRP7-like gene, it has probably arisen recently in the mammalian genomes where it is under purifying selection
NADL2_HUMAN		Although related to the peptidase M28 family, it lacks the conserved zinc-binding and active sites and therefore has probably lost hydrolase activity
NOMO2_HUMAN		There are 3 copies of the NOMO gene on chromosome 16p12-p13: NOMO1 (AC Q15155), NOMO2 and NOMO3 (AC P69849). All 3 are extremely similar, which makes their individual characterization difficult. Thus, most experiments probably do not discriminate between the different members. The results reported in other entries may therefore apply for this protein
DDI2_HUMAN		The protein was initially thought to be catalytically inactive (PubMed:27461074). It was later shown that it has aspartyl protease activity and mediates cleavage of NFE2L1/NRF1 (PubMed:27676298)
MYOME_HUMAN		Was initially reported to localize in the cytoplasm and nucleus (PubMed:11374908). However, many reports in different species have shown that it is associated with the Golgi apparatus and the centrosome
HACD4_HUMAN		Shares some similarity with tyrosine phosphatase proteins but it has probably no phosphatase activity
SHOC1_HUMAN		Although related to the XPF family, the nuclease active site is not conserved
ANO1_HUMAN		Contains ten transmembrane regions, not eight as predicted
NSN5C_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene
RUAS1_HUMAN		Product of a dubious CDS prediction
SL9A4_HUMAN		The number, localization and denomination of hydrophobic domains in the Na(+)/H(+) exchangers vary among authors
ANO7_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-55 is the initiator
ANM9_HUMAN		This protein should not be confused with FBXO11 (AC Q86XK2) that was initially erroneously named PRMT9
DJC24_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-2 is the initiator
NOTUM_HUMAN		The molecular function of NOTUM has remained unclear for many years. It was initially thought to hydrolyze glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains of glypicans, thereby affecting glypicans ability to interact with Wnt ligands. It was later reported to trigger glypican shedding, by mediating cleavage of their GPI-anchor. However, while NOTUM specifically inhibit the Wnt signaling pathway, more pleiotropic effects would be expected from an enzyme affecting glypicans. It was finally shown that it requires glypicans to suppress Wnt signaling, but does not cleave their GPI-anchor. It acts by mediating depalmitoleoylation of WNT proteins, impairing WNT binding to frizzled receptors (PubMed:25731175)
MAP12_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or a Met upstream of this sequence is the initiator
C1TM_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a trifunctional enzyme but only a formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase activity was detected and not a dehydrogenase/cyclohydrogenase activity
SCIMP_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-12 is the initiator
LCLT1_HUMAN		PubMed:16620771 does not detect acyl-CoA:lysocardiolipin acyltransferase activity
ANGL8_HUMAN		Initially reported to specifically promote pancreatic beta cell proliferation without insulin resistance and to promote beta cell mass expansion, thereby improving glucose tolerance (PubMed:23623304). However, this result could not be confirmed by further studies and the original paper was later retracted (PubMed:28038792). The lack of a role in beta cell proliferation was also confirmed in another study (PubMed:25417115)
CASPC_HUMAN		The sequence shown in this entry differs from the translation of the reference genome assembly (GRCh38/hg38) due to a nonsense variant creating stop codon at position 125 in the reference genome
CRDL2_HUMAN		According to PubMed:14660436, interacts with BMP2, BMP4, BMP5, BMP6, BMP7 but not INHBA. According to PubMed:15094188, interacts with INHBA but not BMP2, BMP4 and BMP6
MOT12_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-31 is the initiator
H32_HUMAN		The original paper reporting lysine deamination at Lys-5 by LOXL2 has been retracted due to inappropriate manipulation of figure data (PubMed:22483618, PubMed:27392148). However, this modification was confirmed in a subsequent publication (PubMed:27735137)
FCRLA_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-8 is the initiator
R144B_HUMAN		Lacks the His residue in the RING-type domain 2 that is one of the conserved features of the family
MUC19_HUMAN		According to the Genome Reference Consortium, the reference genome GRCh38/hg38 is in conflict with the sequence shown here
GLT10_HUMAN		According to experiments made in rat, this enzyme is unable to transfer GalNAc onto serine or threonine residue on the protein receptor, but instead requires the prior addition of a GalNAc on a peptide before adding additional GalNAc moieties, thereby acting as a glycopeptide transferase
SETD3_HUMAN		Was initially reported to have histone methyltransferase activity and methylate 'Lys-4' and 'Lys-36' of histone H3 (H3K4me and H3K36me) (By similarity). However, this conclusion was based on mass spectrometry data wherin mass shifts were inconsistent with a bona fide methylation event (PubMed:30626964). In vitro, the protein-lysine methyltransferase activity is weak compared to the protein-histidine methyltransferase activity (PubMed:30526847)
MET16_HUMAN		According to a report, N6-methylation of MAT2A affects MAT2A mRNA stability instead of preventing splicing (By similarity). However, it was later shown that N6-methylation of MAT2A transcripts prevents recognition of their 3'-splice site by U2AF1/U2AF35, thereby inhibiting splicing and protein production (PubMed:33930289)
MET16_HUMAN		Stoichiometry of the protein is unclear. According to two reports, the methyltransferase acts as a monomer (PubMed:30197297, PubMed:30197299). According to a another paper, it acts as a homodimer (PubMed:29593291)
MTMRD_HUMAN		Although it belongs to the non-receptor class myotubularin subfamily, lacks the conserved active site cysteine residue at position 1410 in the dsPTPase catalytic loop, suggesting that it has no phosphatase activity
CTSR3_HUMAN		In mouse, Slco6c1 is an additional auxiliary subunit of the CatSper complex. It is unclear if the related SLCO6A1 protein performs the same role in non-rodent species
NAV2_HUMAN		PubMed:15158073 experiments have been carried out in mouse
SACA3_HUMAN		Although it belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 22 family, Thr-122 and Asn-139 are present instead of the conserved Glu and Asp which are active site residues. It is therefore expected that this protein lacks hydrolase activity
ASXL1_HUMAN		Was previously reported to interact with KDM1A, CBX1, CBX3 and CBX5. However, this publication has been retracted
CJ067_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-2 is the initiator
MYO1H_HUMAN		Represents an unconventional myosin. This protein should not be confused with the conventional myosin-1 (MYH1)
IGSF1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-12 is the initiator
MIGA1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-33 is the initiator
SUMF2_HUMAN		Although strongly similar to formylglycine-generating enzyme, lacks the catalytic Cys residues at positions 261 and 266 that bind the catalytic copper. The catalytic copper is required to activate oxygen and catalyze oxidative C-H activation
MOT11_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-25 is the initiator
ABHD4_HUMAN		Thr-291 is present instead of the conserved His which is expected to be an active site residue
ELP5_HUMAN		The elongator complex was originally thought to play a role in transcription elongation. However, it is no longer thought to play a direct role in this process and its primary function is thought to be in tRNA modification
U2AF4_HUMAN		Orthologs of U2AF1L4 do not appear to exist in lower eukaryotes, Drosophila, C. elegans, plants, or vertebrates such as Xenopus or zebrafish. Existence of circadian and light-inducible alternative splicing of U2AF1L4 similar to the mouse in human and rat is not yet proven
IASPP_HUMAN		An alternative product iASPP(RAI) has been described (PubMed:10336463, PubMed:15489900). However, it is not detected in vivo and is most probably a cloning artifact (PubMed:15489900)
STYX_HUMAN		Contains a Gly residue instead of a conserved Cys residue at position 120 in the dsPTPase catalytic loop which renders it catalytically inactive as a phosphatase. The binding pocket is however sufficiently preserved to bind phosphorylated substrates, and may protect them from phosphatases
CATIN_HUMAN		An ORF (C19orf029 OS) has been described in the opposite strand of the C-terminus of this gene
GLMP_HUMAN		According to PubMed:18021396, it binds DNA and acts as a transcription factor. However, the localization in lysosomes which was confirmed by different groups and the presence of transmembrane region strongly suggests that it does not have coactivator activity
ICEF1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-29 is the initiator
RTF1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-41 is the initiator
KAT2A_HUMAN		According to a report, has weak protein acyltransferase activity compared to protein acetyltransferase activity (PubMed:27377381). These conclusions are however not supported by subsequent studies (PubMed:29211711, PubMed:31542297)
MCUR1_HUMAN		A paper reported that MCUR1 has an indirect role as a regulator of mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) and is involved in cytochrome c oxidase (COX) assembly instead (PubMed:25565209). Subsequent publications however confirmed the function of MCUR1 as a regulator of MCU (PubMed:26445506, PubMed:27184846)
EXOS8_HUMAN		The six exosome core subunits containing a RNase PH-domain are not phosphorolytically active
ERP27_HUMAN		Does not contain a CXXC active site motif indicating that it is a catalytically redox-inactive member of the protein disulfide isomerase family
SEH1_HUMAN		The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of the GATOR2 complex is subject to discussion (PubMed:35831510, PubMed:36528027). According to a report, the GATOR2 complex does not catalyze ubiquitination of the GATOR1 complex (PubMed:35831510). In contrast, another publication showed that the GATOR2 complex mediates ubiquitination of the NPRL2 core component of the GATOR1 complex, leading to GATOR1 inactivation (PubMed:36528027)
C1GLC_HUMAN		Was originally (PubMed:12361956) assigned to be a glycosyltransferase. However, it was later shown (Ref.2 and PubMed:12464682) that it has no transferase activity and rather acts as a chaperone
SAT2_HUMAN		Diamine acetyltransferase activity is unclear (PubMed:12803540, PubMed:15283699). According to a report, mediates acetylation of polyamines, such as norspermidine, spermidine or spermine (PubMed:12803540). However, another publication showed that such activity is weak compared to thialysine acetyltransferase activity, suggesting that polyamines are not substrates in vivo (PubMed:15283699)
HMCES_HUMAN		Was initially reported to specifically bind 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC)-containing DNA in stem cells (By similarity). It was later suggested to act as an endonuclease that specifically cleaves 5hmC-containing DNA (By similarity). However, the endonuclease activity on 5hmC-containing DNA could not be confirmed by another report (PubMed:30554877)
COA8_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-14 is the initiator. However, according to some experiments, Met-14 seems to be the initiator
COA8_HUMAN		First thought to play a role in the regulation of apoptosis, mediating mitochondria-induced cell death in vascular smooth muscle cells through the release of cytochrome c (COX) from mitochondria and the activation of the caspase cascade (By similarity). However, recent studies show that it is not directly involved in apoptosis regulation but in the protection of COX from oxidatively induced degradation (PubMed:25175347, PubMed:30552096)
MRP9_HUMAN		Does not transport any of the organic anions transported by the other multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs) in vesicular transport assays, nor does it confer resistance to cytotoxic agents in intact cell assays
FEM1C_HUMAN		Was initially thought to be the ortholog of mouse FEM1A
ANCHR_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-76 is the initiator. In the liver, the main translation initiation site may be Met-76
UBP47_HUMAN		Was initially thought to catalytically inactive (PubMed:14715245). However, it was later shown that it is active (PubMed:21362556)
BROMI_HUMAN		The Rab-GAP TBC domain appears to be inactive, probably due to a lack of the essential Arg and Gln in the catalytic finger motifs
TOX2_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-52 is the initiator
ALPK1_HUMAN		D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose 1,7-bisphosphate (HBP) was initially thought to constitute the bacterial pathogen-associated molecular pattern metabolite (PAMP) triggering the ALPK1-TIFA innate immunune response (PubMed:28222186, PubMed:28877472). It was however shown that ADP-D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose (ADP-Heptose) constitutes the main PAMP that activates the kinase activity of ALPK1 (PubMed:30111836)
HMCN1_HUMAN		Has been shown in one study to play a role in cleavage furrow maturation during cytokinesis. However, other studies have shown no role in this process
KS6C1_HUMAN		Instead of Lys-820, Arg-820 is found at the binding site
DPYL5_HUMAN		Lacks most of the conserved residues that are essential for binding the metal cofactor and hence for dihydropyrimidinase activity. Its enzyme activity is therefore unsure
COE4_HUMAN		EBF4 expression was not detected in mouse NK cells and CD8(+) T-cells and there were no differences in the NK, CD8(+), and CD4(+) precursor and mature cell subsets in the thymus, spleen, or liver from a mouse EBF4 knockout (PubMed:35939714). It has been suggested, therefore, that the functions of EBF4 differ between humans and mice (PubMed:35939714)
TM175_HUMAN		A publication claims that potassium transport was initially measured with a luminal side pH above 7.0, which is non-physiological for lysosomal channels (PubMed:35750034). This statement is however incorrect as potassium transport was tested at lumenal pH of 5.5, which is considered physiological (PubMed:26317472)
GDAH_HUMAN		Initially proposed to function as agmatinase but this activity was not proved when using the purified enzyme. A recent study showed that it rather functions as a guanidino acid hydrolase
CRDL1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-7 is the initiator
FICD_HUMAN		Was initially thought to mediate AMPylation of HSPA5/BiP at 'Ser-365' and 'Thr-366' in vitro, leading to activate HSPA5/BiP (PubMed:25601083). However, it was later shown that it mediates AMPylation of HSPA5/BiP at 'Thr-518', leading to inactivate HSPA5/BiP
DUS23_HUMAN		Was originally erroneously termed DUSP25
NADAP_HUMAN		PubMed:15764369 initially suggested a role in targeting SLC4A1 (kidney anion exchanger 1) to the plasma membrane; it does not seem to do so as it does not interact with SLC4A1 and has no effect on SLC4A1 trafficking
SUCR1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-5 is the initiator
CAR14_HUMAN		Supposed to contain a SH3 domain which is not detected by PROSITE, Pfam or SMART
ACTBM_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene
PP12C_HUMAN		Although assigned as two separate genes (PPP1R12C and LENG3), it is probable that LENG3 does not exist by itself and is a part of the PPP1R12C gene
UBA5_HUMAN		Was initially reported to mediate activation of SUMO2 in addition to UFM1 (PubMed:18442052). However, it was later shown that it is specific for UFM1 (By similarity)
PEAK1_HUMAN		Has been the subject of controversy surrounding its catalytic capabilities. Early characterization of PEAK1 gave a weak in vitro tyrosine kinase activity (PubMed:20534451). The crystal structure indicates that the kinase-domain contains a closed nucleotide-binding cleft that in this conformation may deleteriously affect nucleotide binding (PubMed:29212708). Furthermore PEAK1 is devoid of nucleotide binding activity, as detected by a thermal-shift assay (PubMed:24107129). So it seems probable that PEAK1 is an inactive kinase
NAA60_HUMAN		According to a report, displays histone acetyltransferase activity while localized in the Golgi apparatus (PubMed:21981917). May mediate acetylation of free histone H4 and promote nucleosome assembly (PubMed:21981917). Such results are however unclear in vivo and recent reports strongly suggest that it acts as a N-alpha-acetyltransferase that specifically targets N-terminal residues of transmembrane proteins (PubMed:21750686, PubMed:25732826)
MINY3_HUMAN		Was named CARP for 'CARD domain-containing protein' by PubMed:12054670. However, no CARD domain is detected by any prediction tool
S39A2_HUMAN		It was previously proposed that SLC39A2 operates as a Zn2(+)/HCO3(-) symport mechanism (PubMed:10681536). However in more recent studies, SLC39A2-mediated transport is independent of both HCO3(-) and H(+)-driving forces, but modulated by extracellular pH and voltage (PubMed:29791142, PubMed:30914478)
MID51_HUMAN		Was submitted as a Xenopus tropicalis sequence in INSDC entry BC090137. However, this sequence appears to be from human
KMT5A_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-72 is the initiator
PLCE_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-12 is the initiator
PANK4_HUMAN		Despite belonging to the type II pantothenate kinase family, the pantothenate kinase domain contains a Val residue at position 147 and a Trp residue at position 211 instead of the two conserved active site residues, Glu and Arg. Lacks pantothenate kinase activity
FANCL_HUMAN		Although PubMed:12724401 reports that it contains a PHD-type zinc finger, it contains a RING-type zinc finger. Moreover, PHD-type zinc fingers do not have any ubiquitin ligase activity
UBAP1_HUMAN		According to a report, can also be a component of ESCRT-I complexes containing VPS37B, VPS37C or VPS37D (PubMed:22405001). However, another publication showed that UBAP1 has specificity for complexes containing VPS37A and not VPS37 paralogs (PubMed:24284069)
C1RL_HUMAN		Does not associate with the C1 complex. According to PubMed:15385675, doesn't cleave the proform of complement C1s
RCC2_HUMAN		Its precise role in the regulation of RAC1 activity is under debate. Was originally proposed to function as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RAC1, but later publications indicate it attenuates RAC1 activation by guanine nucleotide exchange factors and prevents accumulation of active, GTP-bound RAC1 (PubMed:12919680, PubMed:25074804, PubMed:28869598). Conflicting results have also been reported regarding its preferential interaction with nucleotide-free RAC1, as opposed to GPD or GTP-bound RAC1 (PubMed:12919680, PubMed:25074804)
RHG20_HUMAN		The translocation involving this gene was originally published as t(X;11)(q13;23), but BRWD3 is localized to Xq21 and not to Xq13
CING_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-7 is the initiator
BUP1_HUMAN		The purified enzyme was shown to contain 0.5 zinc atoms per subunit, and sequence analysis was used to predict the zinc binding site (PubMed:11508704). The crystal structure indicates a lack of bound zinc ions, and shows that the residues that were predicted to bind zinc are too far apart in space to form a zinc binding site (PubMed:29976570)
KLHL3_HUMAN		The BCR(KLHL3) complex was initially thought to act by mediating ubiquitination of SLC12A3/NCC (PubMed:22406640). However, it was later shown that effects on SLC12A3/NCC are indirect and caused by impaired ubiquitination of WNK4 (PubMed:23387299)
GGA1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-5 is the initiator
MYH2_HUMAN		Represents a conventional myosin. This protein should not be confused with the unconventional myosin-2 (MYO2) found in fungi
KI26A_HUMAN		In contrast to other kinesin-like proteins, residues required for ATPase activity are missing
PPM1H_HUMAN		A report observed N-glycosylation at Asn-354 (PubMed:19139490). However, as the protein is not predicted to localize in an extracellular compartment of the cell, additional evidence is required to confirm this result
KMT2B_HUMAN		This protein was first named MLL2 by PubMed:10637508 and PubMed:10409430. MLL2 corresponds to another protein located on chromosome 12 (see AC O14686). Thus, KMT2B/MLL4 is often referred to as MLL2 and vice versa in the literature
MNAR1_HUMAN		MINAR1 topology is a matter of debate, some authors think the N-terminus is extracellular, while preliminary experimental results suggest a cytosolic location
XCT_HUMAN		In the PMID:15151999, a typographical error has been introduced leading to L-cysteine spelling instead of L-cystine
CD11A_HUMAN		Many references talk about 'p110 isoforms' but it is not yet known if this refers to CDK11A and/or CDK11B or one/some of the isoforms of each
BAIP2_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-59 is the initiator
POMP_HUMAN		Although this protein has been named voltage-gated K channel beta subunit 4.1 in Ref.1 and Ref.2, there is no evidence that it may play a role in ion transport
TLR6_HUMAN		In some plant proteins and in human SARM1, the TIR domain has NAD(+) hydrolase (NADase) activity (By similarity). However, despite the presence of the catalytic Asp residue, the isolated TIR domain of human TLR4 lacks NADase activity (By similarity). Based on this, it is unlikely that Toll-like receptors have NADase activity
BOLA1_HUMAN		Was initially reported to be secreted via a non-classical export pathway (PubMed:18548201). It was however later shown that it localizes to mitochondria, in agreement with other members of the family (PubMed:22746225)
WNK2_HUMAN		Was named WNK/'with no lysine(K)' because key residues for catalysis, including the lysine involved in ATP binding, are either not conserved or differ compared to the residues described in other kinase family proteins
WAC2C_HUMAN		One study reported a nucleation-promoting factor (NPF) activity towards the Arp2/3 complex using partially purified samples of the WASH complex (PubMed:19922875). In another study, the in vitro reconstituted and purified recombinant WASH core complex, consisting of WASHC3, WASHC4, WASHC5, WASHC1 and the N-terminal residues 1-356 of WASHC2, did not show activity toward Arp2/3 complex (PubMed:20498093)
YTHD2_HUMAN		The role of YTHDF2 and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in virus expression and replication is unclear (PubMed:29109479, PubMed:29447282, PubMed:29659627, PubMed:30559377). According to some reports, YTHDF2 promotes viral gene expression and replication of polyomavirus SV40 and herpesvirus (KSHV) by binding to N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-containing viral RNAs (PubMed:29447282, PubMed:29659627). Another report however suggests that YTHDF2 regulates virus expression and replication indirectly, via its ability to inhibit the type I interferon response, thereby promoting virus expression (PubMed:30559377). Indirect regulation via inhibition of type I interferon response might explain why contradictory results have been reported for its role in KSHV virus replication (PubMed:29109479, PubMed:29659627)
YTHD2_HUMAN		Previous studies suggested the 3 different paralogs (YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3) have unique functions with limited redundancy (PubMed:26046440). However, later studies showed that YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3 paralogs have redundant functions to a profound extent and directly promote degradation of m6A-containing mRNAs (PubMed:32492408)
HEBP2_HUMAN		Has been described as heme-binding protein in mouse, but His-42, a residue essential for heme binding in mouse, is not conserved in all orthologs, or in the heme-binding family member HEBP1
CP2D7_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene
CD3CH_HUMAN		The sequence shown in this entry differs from the translation of the reference genome assembly (GRCh38/hg38) due to a variant (dbSNP:rs905709) in the reference genome which abolishes the intron 1 donor splice site leading to loss of CD300H transcripts
UBP27_HUMAN		Although strongly related to USP22, which deubiquitinates histones, lacks the N-terminal UBP-type zinc finger, suggesting it does not have the ability to deubiquitinate histones
SFI1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-24 is the initiator
GBRR3_HUMAN		The sequence shown in this entry differs from the translation of the reference genome assembly (GRCh38/hg38) due to a nonsense variant creating stop codon at position 205 in the reference genome
BBIP1_HUMAN		Was previously thought to be non-coding and described as 'non-protein coding RNA 81', abbreviated NCRNA00081
MYO1G_HUMAN		Represents an unconventional myosin. This protein should not be confused with the conventional myosin-1 (MYH1)
HACD1_HUMAN		Isoform 1 shares some similarity with tyrosine phosphatase proteins but it has probably no phosphatase activity
SUMO5_HUMAN		Defined as a pseudogene by HGNC. However the existence of the functional protein is supported by the inhibition of its expression and its function using siRNAs specifically targeting SUMO1P1/SUMO5
FZD9_HUMAN		Has been first described as FZD3 in literature
MYO1F_HUMAN		Represents an unconventional myosin. This protein should not be confused with the conventional myosin-1 (MYH1)
PSMD9_HUMAN		Was initially identified as a component of the 26S proteasome
AGRIN_HUMAN		The unknown residue 'x' in the transmembrane isoform is probably a proline residue by similarity to mouse and rat sequences
P3C2B_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-26 is the initiator
AIM2_HUMAN		According to a report, AIM2 is autoinhibited in absence of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) due to an interaction between the pyrin and HIN-200 domains that induce a closed conformation (PubMed:22483801). However, it was later shown that AIM2 is not autoinhibited and that dsDNA acts as a molecular ruler to promote its homooligomerization (PubMed:26197926)
KLF11_HUMAN		PubMed:11087666 sequence was originally thought to originate from mouse
OBRG_HUMAN		This protein is encoded by LEPR gene, but shares with LEPR only the first two 5'-UTR exons. It therefore does not share any sequence similarity with LEPR
GPR42_HUMAN		The sequence shown in this entry differs from the translation of the reference genome assembly (GRCh38/hg38) due to a missense variant at position 174 in the reference genome, that results in the loss of response to short chain fatty acids, including propionate
CYB5B_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-5 is the initiator
IRAK2_HUMAN		Asn-335 is present instead of the conserved Asp which is expected to be an active site residue. This enzyme has been shown to be catalytically inactive
ARK72_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-30 is the initiator
CPSF5_HUMAN		Lacks the conserved metal-binding residues in the NUDIX motif and does not have hydrolase activity
CREB3_HUMAN		All experiments concerning the proteolytic cleavage are done with isoform 1
EXTL3_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1, Met-6 or Met-20 is the initiator
CHST1_HUMAN		Was originally (PubMed:9639683) thought to be the ortholog of chicken CHST3 and therefore named C6ST. However, it has no strong chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase activity
NMT2_HUMAN		Sequence AAF36406.2 was incorrectly indicated as originating from bovine
CPNE3_HUMAN		Was reported to have a protein kinase activity
TNR21_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-25 is the initiator
PSD10_HUMAN		Was initially identified as a genuine component of the 26S proteasome
AP1G2_HUMAN		Does not appear to be a subunit of the clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1)
MYO1D_HUMAN		Contrary to the situation in zebrafish, xenopus and drosophila, mammalian MYO1D defects have no effects on left-right body asymmetry
MYO1D_HUMAN		Represents an unconventional myosin. This protein should not be confused with the conventional myosin-1 (MYH1)
ELP1_HUMAN		The elongator complex was originally thought to play a role in transcription elongation. However, it is no longer thought to play a direct role in this process and its primary function is thought to be in tRNA modification
LETM1_HUMAN		There are conflicting results concerning the role of LETM1 as a mitochondrial proton/calcium exchanger. According to (PubMed:19797662, PubMed:24344246, PubMed:29123128) LETM1 has been shown to function as a proton/calcium exchanger. However (PubMed:36321428) demonstrates the absence of this function in LETM1
RPGF3_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-43 is the initiator
CEP43_HUMAN		Interacting region of CEP19 is conflicting: According to a report, interacts via N-terminus (PubMed:28428259). According to another report, interacts via C-terminus (PubMed:28659385)
SNAI1_HUMAN		The interaction with mouse KPNA2 may prevent SNAI1 nuclear import
NSD2_HUMAN		Depending on the experimental set up and substrate used, NSD2 has been shown to mono-, di- or tri-methylate 'Lys-27', 'Lys-36' or 'Lys-79' of histone H3 and 'Lys-20' or 'Lys-44' of histone H4 (PubMed:19808676). However, dimethylation of nucleosomal histone H3 at 'Lys-36' (H3K36me2) is likely to be the physiological reaction catalyzed by NSD2 (PubMed:19808676, PubMed:22099308)
HPT_HUMAN		Although homologous to serine proteases, it has lost all essential catalytic residues and has no enzymatic activity
KVD33_HUMAN		For an example of a full-length immunoglobulin kappa light chain see AC P0DOX7
KV133_HUMAN		For an example of a full-length immunoglobulin kappa light chain see AC P0DOX7
KV117_HUMAN		For an example of a full-length immunoglobulin kappa light chain see AC P0DOX7

CO4A1_HUMAN		Was shown to inhibit expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha and ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK activation, and to function as a ligand for alpha1/beta1 integrin. However, this study was later retracted
ALBU_HUMAN		A peptide arising from positions 166 to 174 was originally (PubMed:3087352, PubMed:2437111) termed neurotensin-related peptide (NRP) or kinetensin and was thought to regulate fat digestion, lipid absorption, and blood flow
WNT1_HUMAN		A palmitoylation site was proposed at Cys-93, but it was later shown that this cysteine is engaged in a disulfide bond
A4_HUMAN		Was reported to bind TNFRSF21 triggering caspase activation and degeneration of both neuronal cell bodies (via caspase-3) and axons (via caspase-6) (PubMed:19225519). This work was later retracted (PubMed:38110576)
IF2A_HUMAN		This gene should not be confused with EIF2A, with which it shares the alias EIF2A. Although both of these proteins function in binding initiator tRNA to the 40S ribosomal subunit, the eIF2 complex requires GTP, whereas the EIF2A protein does so in a codon-dependent manner
KV401_HUMAN		For an example of a full-length immunoglobulin kappa light chain see AC P0DOX7
IF4E_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be phosphorylated on Ser-53 (PubMed:3112145); this was later shown to be wrong (PubMed:7665584)
PTPRC_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-3 is the initiator
ABHD2_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a G-coupled receptor
CSF3_HUMAN		PubMed:2420009 misquotes the gene name as 'CSF1'
ST1A4_HUMAN		Found in a segmental duplication on p arm of chromosome 16 giving rise to two identical copies of this gene sharing exons with SLX1A and SLX1B. The ORFs of SULT1A3 and SULT1A4 differ with only a single nucleotide change that does not alter the encoded amino acid. It is not possible to determine whether any individual polymorphism is present within SULT1A3 or SULT1A4 (PubMed:15358107)
PYDC4_HUMAN		Likely derived from retrogene insertion of an NLRP2/NLRP7-like gene, it was originally considered a pseudogene. However, it turns out to be functional and under purifying selection
TRAR1_HUMAN		This sequence is an example of a full-length TR alpha chain. M/matrix protein 1-specific TRAV27*01J42*01C*01 TR alpha chain is generated by somatic recombination of variable TRAV27 (AC A0A087WT01) and joining TRAJ42 (AC A0A075B6Y9) gene segments spliced to constant TRAC (AC P01848) gene segment
AMY1A_HUMAN		Three distinct genes (AMY1A, AMY1B and AMY1C), located in a gene cluster on 1p21, encode proteins sharing the same peptidic sequence
TZAP_HUMAN		According to a study, preferentially binds to long telomeres that have a low concentration of shelterin complex (PubMed:28082411). According to another report, binds telomeres regardless of their length (PubMed:28500257)
RET3_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-2 is the initiator
CD20_HUMAN		Epitope 1, mapped in PubMed:16785532, is predicted to be buried in the membrane. Its accessibility to the extracellular space, and thus to antibody recognition, is not explained
QCR7_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be the ubiquinone-binding protein (QP-C)
HIS1_HUMAN		Has been reported to promote cell proliferation (PubMed:18650243). However other studies were unable to demonstrate any cell proliferation activity (PubMed:25903106, PubMed:28542418, PubMed:28751526, PubMed:32225006). The peptide named histatin 2 was mistakenly described as the non-phosphorylated form of histatin 1 by some authors (PubMed:17503797)

H2A1D_HUMAN		Was originally thought to originate from mouse
EVI2A_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-5 is the initiator

FCG2B_HUMAN		Has sometimes been attributed to correspond to FcR-IIC
GP183_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-5 is the initiator
CD68_HUMAN		CD68 is a commonly used marker for macrophages. However, a number of studies (PubMed:15194571, PubMed:15647451, PubMed:18405323) have shown that CD68 antibodies react with other hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell types, suggesting that CD68 may not be a macrophage-specific antigen
SOX18_HUMAN		Was originally termed SOX-8
COIA1_HUMAN		Non-collagenous domain 1 seems to be the predominant tissue form from which endostatin is cleaved. However, the proteolytic cleavage site to generate non-collagenous domain 1 is not known. Soluble recombinant non-collagenous domain 1 amenable to biochemical studies has been used instead
GRIA3_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-7 is the initiator
RS27_HUMAN		Was originally (PubMed:8407955) thought to be a protein that could have played a role as a potentially important mediator of cellular proliferative responses to various growth factors and other environmental signals. Capable of specific binding to a cAMP response element in DNA
BTD_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-21 is the initiator
KI67_HUMAN		Was thought to play a key role in cell proliferation, and is commonly used as a marker of cell proliferation (PubMed:21960707, PubMed:6339421). However, its primary function is uncoupled from cell proliferation: it is required to maintain mitotic chromosomes dispersed by forming a steric and electrostatic charge barrier (PubMed:27362226)
GPR4_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a receptor for sphingosylphosphorylcholine and lysophosphatidylcholine (PubMed:11535583). However, this work has been retracted
PI42A_HUMAN		This protein was previously thought to be a phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase
LRBA_HUMAN		Was originally said to be similar to yeast CDC4, but that similarity is very limited
HCFC1_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be part of the MLL5-L complex, at least composed of KMT2E, STK38, PPP1CA, PPP1CB, PPP1CC, HCFC1, ACTB and OGT (PubMed:19377461). However, the corresponding article has been retracted (PubMed:24336203)
CCR8_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a receptor for SCYA3 and SCYA17
UBP14_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a guanine tRNA-ribosyltransferase
IOD3_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-27 is the initiator
MANF_HUMAN		Was originally (PubMed:8649854, PubMed:8971156, PubMed:9174057) thought to be much longer and included an arginine-rich region thought to be the target of cancer-causing mutations. All these mutations are in what is now thought to be the 5'-UTR of the mRNA
MANF_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-4 is the initiator
CAV3_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-2 is the initiator
DAOA_HUMAN		PubMed:12364586, PubMed:24362575, and PubMed:29114206 show that DAOA activates DAO, however the results could not be reproduced by PubMed:18544534. Instead, PubMed:18544534 found that it acts as a repressor of DAO. Conversely, PubMed:17684499 reported that DAOA does not activate, interact, or colocalize with DAO, whereas PubMed:21679769 suggested that they may colocalize prior to the peroxisomal import of DAO. The mitochondrial activity is also disputed with PubMed:18544534 reporting its absence and PubMed:17684499 and PubMed:25078755 its presence in the mitochondrion
CXCR4_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a receptor for neuropeptide Y type 3 (NPY3R) (NPY3-R) (PubMed:8234909, PubMed:8329116). Later reports showed that it acts as a receptor for the C-X-C chemokine CXCL12/SDF-1 (PubMed:10825158, PubMed:12034737, PubMed:9427609)
NOMO3_HUMAN		There are 3 copies of the NOMO gene on chromosome 16p12-p13: NOMO1 (AC Q5JPE7), NOMO2 (AC Q5JPE7) and NOMO3. All 3 are extremely similar, which makes their individual characterization difficult. Thus, most experiments probably do not discriminate between the different members. The results reported in other entries may therefore apply for this protein
HBG1_HUMAN		The modification form of Leu-142 is subject of controversy and could be the artifactual result of sample handling
DRB3_HUMAN		HLA-DRB3, HLA-DRB4 and HLA-DRB5 may represent a unique gene
GPSM2_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-8 is the initiator
GPSM2_HUMAN		Mutations in GPSM2 have been identified in people with profound congenital non-syndromic deafness designated as DFNB82 (PubMed:20602914). Subsequent brain imaging of these individuals has revealed frontal polymicrogyria, abnormal corpus callosum, and gray matter heterotopia, consistent with a diagnosis of Chudley-McCullough syndrome (PubMed:22578326)
MDM2_HUMAN		A report observed N-glycosylation at Asn-349 (PubMed:19139490). However, as the protein is not extracellular, additional evidence is required to confirm this result
FOXK2_HUMAN		Was initially named FOXK1a by some reports (PubMed:12402362, PubMed:16624804). It should not be confused with FOXK1 (AC P85037) paralog
ERCC6_HUMAN		PMID:16916636 was retracted due to image manipulations
DEUP1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-9 is the initiator
TWF1_HUMAN		Was originally thought to have protein tyrosine kinase activity
HYAL2_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be lysosomal
REST_HUMAN		Controversial data exists concerning the repressor activity of isoform 3. A study showed that isoform 3 exhibits weak repressor activity of a NRSE motif-containing reporter construct (PubMed:11779185). Another report, however, does not observe any isoform 3 transcriptional repressor activity of a NRSE motif-containing reporter construct (PubMed:11741002). Controversial data also exists regarding the function of isoform 3 on the negative regulation of isoform 1. It was shown that isoform 3 negatively regulates the repressor activity of isoform 1 by binding to isoform 1, thereby preventing its binding to NRSE and leading to derepression of target genes (PubMed:11779185). Another study, however, did not observe any inhibitory activity of isoform 3 on the isoform 1 transcriptional repressor activity (PubMed:11741002)
PAK1_HUMAN		The interaction between DSCAM, PAK1 and RAC1 has beend described. This article has been withdrawn by the authors
PAK1_HUMAN		There are data describing interaction and regulation by the product of CRIPAK, a putative single exon gene (PubMed:16278681). However, considering all available data there is no sufficient supporting evidence for the existence of such protein
CBX3_HUMAN		Was previously reported to interact with ASXL1. However, this publication has been retracted
STK3_HUMAN		PUBMED:20231902 has been retracted because there was evidence of data fabrication and/or falsification in multiple figure panels
NMI_HUMAN		The TRIM21-mediated ubiquitinated residue is not conserved in mice, therefore it remains unclear whether the physiological role of NMI ubiquitination is preserved throughout mammals
XRCC4_HUMAN		Sumoylation at Lys-210 was initially reported to regulate nuclear localization and recombination efficiency of XRCC4 (PubMed:16478998). This result is however not confirmed by another study (PubMed:25934149)
ADAM9_HUMAN		Has sometimes been referred to as ADAM-12
KEAP1_HUMAN		The mechanism of inactivation of the BCR(KEAP1) complex by covalent modifications of reactive cysteines is unclear. Covalent modifications were initially thought to disrupt interaction between KEAP1 and NFE2L2/NRF2 (By similarity). Recent publications suggest that cysteine modifications disrupt the interaction between KEAP1 and CUL3 without affecting the interaction between KEAP1 and NFE2L2/NRF2 (PubMed:16006525, PubMed:17127771, PubMed:18251510, PubMed:24896564)
DPYL1_HUMAN		Lacks most of the conserved residues that are essential for binding the metal cofactor and hence for dihydropyrimidinase activity. Its enzyme activity is therefore unsure
ICT1_HUMAN		Was initially thought to promote the termination of non-canonical termination stop codons AGG and AGA (PubMed:24352605). However, it was later shown that termination of non-canonical termination stop codons is mediated by MTRF1 (PubMed:37141370)
ICT1_HUMAN		In contrast to other members of the family, lacks the regions that come into close contact with the mRNA in the ribosomal A-site and determine the STOP codon specificity, explaining the loss of codon specificity for translation release factor activity
FRG1_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be located in nuclear speckles based on overexpression of the protein (PubMed:15060122). However, the endogenous protein was later shown not be expressed in nuclear speckles (PubMed:21699900)
MDC1_HUMAN		Phosphorylation at Ser-329 and Thr-331 by CK2 was initially thought to play a major role in the interaction with TOPBP1 (PubMed:23891287). However, it was later shown that phosphorylation at Ser-168 and Ser-196 promote interaction with TOPBP1 (PubMed:30898438)
NPT1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-3 is the initiator
K2C72_HUMAN		Was initially thought to be the ortholog of mouse KRT71
SETB1_HUMAN		Was reported to be recruited by MBD1, during DNA replication, to form a S phase-specific complex that would facilitate methylation of H3 'Lys-9' during replication-coupled chromatin assembly and would be at least composed of the CAF-1 subunit CHAF1A, MBD1 and SETDB1 (PubMed:15327775, PubMed:17066076). However, these papers have been retracted because some data, results and conclusions are not reliable (PubMed:30849389, PubMed:31612521)
SETB1_HUMAN		Was reported to trimethylate H3 'Lys-9', to interact with CHD7, NLK1 and PPARG and to be phosphorylated at Thr-796 (PubMed:17952062). However, this work was later retracted although its role in H3 'Lys-9' trimethylation is supported by other papers (PubMed:25358353)
PLCL1_HUMAN		In the PI-PLC X-box Asn-458 is present instead of the conserved His which is one of the active site residues. It is therefore expected that this protein lacks catalytic activity
STK38_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be part of the MLL5-L complex, at least composed of KMT2E, STK38, PPP1CA, PPP1CB, PPP1CC, HCFC1, ACTB and OGT (PubMed:19377461). However, the corresponding article has been retracted (PubMed:24336203)
DLGP5_HUMAN		It was localized to the spindle and the spindle pole (PubMed:12527899) but was later found to be localized to the spindle and to be excluded from the spindle pole (PubMed:15561729)
TLR1_HUMAN		In some plant proteins and in human SARM1, the TIR domain has NAD(+) hydrolase (NADase) activity (By similarity). However, despite the presence of the catalytic Asp residue, the isolated TIR domain of human TLR4 lacks NADase activity (By similarity). Based on this, it is unlikely that Toll-like receptors have NADase activity
TCEA2_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-2 is the initiator
ACHA2_HUMAN		With the use of epibatidine as high affinity ligand, an alpha-2 homopentamer has been purified and crystallized. Its physiological relevance has not been proven
SCN9A_HUMAN		SCN9A has been originally reported to be involved in generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) (PubMed:19763161). However, it has later been shown that SCN9A variants are not a likely cause of autosomal dominant febrile seizures/febrile seizures plus and other monogenic seizure phenotypes (PubMed:33216760)
ADRM1_HUMAN		Although initially described as a cell membrane glycoprotein, ADRM1 is intracellular and non-glycosylated, and has probably no direct role in cell adhesion
KYNU_HUMAN		It has been reported that this enzyme possesses no measurable activity against L-kynurenine and is subject to inhibition by both L-kynurenine and D-kynurenine at pH 7.9
DUS7_HUMAN		An out-of-frame translation product, PYST2SB, has been experimentally demonstrated to be formed from the alternative promoter. The expression of the in-frame product has not yet been shown
CP51A_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-7 is the initiator
ABCB5_HUMAN		Was named ABCB1 by some authors
ERC6L_HUMAN		Was initially thought to play a role in the spindle checkpoint. However, it was later shown that phenotypes initially observed are due to off-target effects of the siRNA used which results in MAD2L1 down-regulation and mis-localization
ZACN_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-2 is the initiator
PAR14_HUMAN		The role of PARP14-mediated ADP-ribosylation of STAT1 in the prevention of STAT1 phosphorylation has been called into question and it has been suggested that the inhibition of phosphorylation may be the result of sumoylation of STAT1 'Lys-703'
AGK_HUMAN		According to a report, the N-terminal hydrophobic region forms a transmembrane region that crosses the mitochondrion inner membrane (PubMed:28712726). According to another report, the N-terminal hydrophobic region associates with the membrane without crossing it (PubMed:28712724)
KHDC3_HUMAN		The role of human KHDC3L in the restart of replication forks is unclear as it has been shown to not be involved in the process (PubMed:31609975). However it has been shown that the KHDC3L ortholog in macaque is required for the process (By similarity)
LY65C_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-4 is the initiator
GT253_HUMAN		Has no glucosyltransferase activity. Concerning beta-galactosyltransferase activity, the level of CERCAM could be too low to detect any activity when tested in transfected insect cells
TTBK1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-14 is the initiator
CBPC2_HUMAN		Was initially shown to catalyze the removal of carboxy-terminus tyrosine from alpha-tubulin (PubMed:21303978). However, later studies did not identified any detyrosinase or deglycylase activities from the carboxy-terminus of tubulin (By similarity)
CBPC2_HUMAN		Was originally thought to have detyrosinating activity from C-terminal positions on tubulin
RN213_HUMAN		The stoichiometry is unclear: was initially thought to form homohexamers (PubMed:24658080, PubMed:26126547). However, the electron microscopy structure showed that it is monomeric and is composed of six ATPase modules within a single polypeptide chain (By similarity)
CP4FN_HUMAN		A second transmembrane domain at positions 95-115 is predicted by three programs ESKW, MEMSAT and Phobius. However experimental evidence supports the presence of a single signal-anchor transmembrane domain at the N-terminus
FXL22_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-7 is the initiator
RNK_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-40 is the initiator. Orthologous sequences cannot be extended
CNKR3_HUMAN		The gene name MAGI1, shown in this entry as a synonym, is an obsolete human gene nomenclature committee-approved name. It should be noted that MAGI1 currently is the official name for the unrelated membrane-associated guanylate kinase, WW and PDZ domain-containing protein 1
GTR7_HUMAN		According to some reports, mediates transmembrane transport of glucose and fructose (PubMed:15033637, PubMed:16186102, PubMed:29548810). However, another group could not confirm transporter activity for glucose or fructose (PubMed:28083649)
APOA5_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-4 is the initiator
WDR82_HUMAN		The gene encoding this protein shares one overlapping exon with TMEM113
UBP53_HUMAN		Although the active site residues are conserved, lacks the conserved His residue which is normally found 9 residues before the catalytic His
TM10C_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-7 is the initiator
TM10C_HUMAN		The identity of the enzyme catalyzing mitochondrial mRNA N(1)-methyltransferase is unclear. According to a report, mitochondrial mRNA N(1)-methyltransferase activity is catalyzed by TRMT61B (AC Q9BVS5) (PubMed:29107537). According to a second report, it is mediated by TRMT10C (PubMed:29072297). As both reports only tested one protein (either TRMT61B or TRMT10C), it is possible that both proteins have this activity
NDUF7_HUMAN		Stoichiometry of the protein is unclear. According to a report, it forms a homodimer (PubMed:20406883). According to another publication, it is mainly monomeric (PubMed:24838397)
GRP2_HUMAN		Defects in RASGRP2 were initially thought (PubMed:17576779) to be the cause of leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 3 (LAD3), a syndrome characterized by recurrent bacterial infections and major bleeding disorders. However, it was later shown (PubMed:19064721, PubMed:19234463, PubMed:19234460) that it is not the case and that LAD3 is caused by defects in FERMT3 gene
BN3D2_HUMAN		There is some controversy about O-methyltransferase on pre-miR-145, since the dimethylation first described as the specific enzymatic activity cannot be reproduced by a more recent work which observes a monomethylation of pre-miR-145 but two orders weaker than the methylation of cytosolic histidyl tRNA
BMP8A_HUMAN		Experiments with human recombinant protein (in mouse system by intracerebroventricular treatment) are reported for BMP8B but the protein is corresponding to BMP8A according sequence data provided by the supplier; related experiments with Bmp8b-/- mice show similar results
NAL10_HUMAN		Despite its official name, does not contain LRR repeats
NAL10_HUMAN		Was originally thought to play a role in adaptive immunity through control of dendritic cell-mediated antigen transport to lymph nodes from peripheral sites. However, this was later shown to be dependent on DOCK8
ZC3C1_HUMAN		Reported to contain a F-box domain. Such domain is however not predicted by any detection method and Gunkel et al. does not confirm experimentally the F-box domain (PubMed:34440706). Moreover, there are some discrepancies about the function of ZC3HC1 and its binding partners (PubMed:12748172, PubMed:16009132, PubMed:34440706). Gunkel et al. shows that, in interphase, ZC3HC1 is neither a binding partner of SKP1 nor is be part of the SCF(NIPA) E3 complex with SKP1, RBX1 and CUL1 as Bassermann et al. reported it (PubMed:16009132, PubMed:34440706). In addition, Gunkel et al. shows that it does not interacts with CCNB1 and consequently that it does not directly involved in regulating the subcellular distribution and amounts of CCNB1 in proliferating cells in interphase as Bassermann et al. reported it (PubMed:16009132, PubMed:34440706). Finally, Gunkel et al. does not find that ZC3HC1 is a binding partner of the oncogenic tyrosine kinase NPM-ALK fusion protein through which it would be function as an anti-apoptotic protein as Oyang T. et al. has initially reported (PubMed:12748172, PubMed:34440706)
TEN1L_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-2 is the initiator. Some orthologous sequences cannot be extended
LSR_HUMAN		In contrast to the rodent orthologous protein, it is longer in N-terminus and no signal sequence is detected by any prediction method
CTSRD_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-5 is the initiator
CTSRD_HUMAN		In mouse, Slco6c1 is an additional auxiliary subunit of the CatSper complex. It is unclear if the related SLCO6A1 protein performs the same role in non-rodent species
KRA71_HUMAN		The sequence of 1-36 of PubMed:12359730 has not been submitted
AEBP1_HUMAN		Although related to peptidase M14 family, lacks the active site residues and zinc-binding sites, suggesting that it has no carboxypeptidase activity
PLD3_HUMAN		It was initially thought that PDL3 has phospholipase D activity due to its HKD motifs. The second HKD motif contains Glu instead of the canonical Asp. Its enzyme activity is therefore unsure. Catalytic phospholipase D activity is still controversial (PubMed:29053796, PubMed:30312375). Its closest homolog PLD4, exhibits no phospholipase activity (By similarity)
KSR1_HUMAN		Although it belongs to the protein kinase superfamily, the ATP-binding motif VAIK has an arginine instead of a lysine residue suggesting that KSR1 cannot bind ATP and therefore lacks protein kinase activity. However, KSR1 is capable of binding ATP (PubMed:29433126). Has protein kinase activity towards MAP2K1 in the presence of RAF1/c-RAF in vitro (By similarity)
MAPK5_HUMAN		The role of p38 MAPK kinases is unclear in phosphorylation and activation of MAPKAPK5. According to some reports, it interacts and is phosphorylated by p38-alpha/MAPK14 and p38-beta/MAPK11 (PubMed:12808055, PubMed:9628874). According to other reports, it is not activated by p38-alpha/MAPK14 and p38-beta/MAPK11. An explanation for these discrepancies, might be that the interaction with p38 MAPK kinases is weak and occurs only under specific conditions
CLYBL_HUMAN		This organism lacks the other subunits that are necessary for ATP-independent citrate lyase activity. Even though this protein has clear similarity to citrate lyase beta subunit, it is expected to have a somewhat different enzyme activity
PPM1K_HUMAN		PubMed:18058037 has crystallized PPM1K in the presence of magnesium ions. However, PubMed:17336929 reported that no activity toward p-nitrophenylphosphate was seen in the absence of manganese ions and magnesium could not substitute for manganese
DPP10_HUMAN		Gly-651 is present instead of the conserved Ser which is expected to be an active site residue suggesting that this protein has no peptidase activity
EFNMT_HUMAN		Was thought to negatively regulate cell proliferation at G1/S transition via transcriptional suppression of cell cycle regulatory genes. However this publication has been retracted due to unexplained image anomalies
S2529_HUMAN		Was initially proposed to transport palmitoylcarnitine, based on complementation experiments in yeast mutants lacking CRC1 and CIT2 and release of radiolabeled carnitine from mitochondria incubated with radiolabeled palmitoylcarnithine (By similarity). Later experiments done primarily with human indicate the protein functions instead as transporter of basic amino acids (PubMed:24652292)
SUMF1_HUMAN		The disulfide bond observed in the structure does not exist in vivo (PubMed:15907468). The enzyme reaction was initially thought to act via a redox-active disulfide bond mechanism; however the disulfide bond only takes place with inactive enzyme that lacks the copper cofactor (PubMed:25931126). The catalytic copper is required to activate oxygen and catalyze oxidative C-H activation (PubMed:25931126)
FNDC9_HUMAN		Encoded in intron of the gene CYFIP2 (opposite strand)
CPT1C_HUMAN		In contrast to its paralogs, CPT1A and CPT1B, does not have, or at very low levels, carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase activity (EC:2.3.1.21) in vivo, being unable to catalyze the transfer of the acyl group of long-chain fatty acid-CoA conjugates onto carnitine. This is in agreement with its expression specific to neurons which is a cell-type that does not use fatty acids as fuel to any major extent and the fact that it locates to endoplasmic reticulum instead of mitochondria
RHBL4_HUMAN		One study reported that the protein is not localized in the mitochondrion
PTPM1_HUMAN		Was originally erroneously termed DUSP23
S38A5_HUMAN		Nakanishi et al (PubMed:11243884) shows that the transport process is electrogenic, contrary to the conclusions of Hamdani et al (PMID:11742981) who finds that the transport is electroneutral with a Na(+):L-glutamine stoichiometry of 1:1 (PubMed:11243884). Hamdani et al (PMID:11742981) shows that this electrogenic transport describes by Nakanishi et al. would correspond to large uncoupled fluxes of protons (PubMed:11243884)
ZN480_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-20 is the initiator. A 'GT' insertion (rs59214675) allows to extend the sequence in the N-terminus. The majority of mRNAs do not have this insertion and the corresponding protein sequences start at Met-20
RXFP2_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-18 is the initiator
ATG4A_HUMAN		A paper describing ATG4D tissue expression has been retracted, due to concerns of image duplication in some of the figures
DDX1_HUMAN		According to some authors the unwinding activity is ADP-dependent and not ATP-dependent
PEX13_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-40 is the initiator
TRI63_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-14 is the initiator
HDA10_HUMAN		Protein/histone deacetylase activity in vivo is uncertain. The 3D structure analysis of the zebrafish ortholog shows that a glutamate gatekeeper and a sterically constricted active site confer specificity for N(8)-acetylspermidine hydrolysis and disfavour acetyllysine hydrolysis. Supporting this observation, has been shown to exhibit only very low activity, if any, towards acetyl-lysine peptide substrates (PubMed:28516954). However, histone deacetylase activity has been observed in vitro (PubMed:11677242, PubMed:11726666, PubMed:11739383, PubMed:11861901, PubMed:28516954). Has also been shown to be involved in MSH2 deacetylation (PubMed:26221039)
SPTSA_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-4 is the initiator
UPP_HUMAN		No UPRTase activity has been detected in vitro and the uracil binding region known from UPRTases is missing
ORAI1_HUMAN		According to a report, ORAI1 has been shown to colocalize with UBQLN1 in the autophagosome as a target for autophagic degradation; ORAI1 is however not an autophagosomal protein
ATG4C_HUMAN		A paper describing ATG4C tissue expression and activity has been retracted, due to concerns of image duplication in some of the figures
OMA1_HUMAN		Was initially reported to localize in the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:12886954). However, it was later shown that it localizes to mitochondrion (PubMed:20038677)
ELP4_HUMAN		The elongator complex was originally thought to play a role in transcription elongation. However, it is no longer thought to play a direct role in this process and its primary function is thought to be in tRNA modification
S35A4_HUMAN		The translation and the expression of this protein may be maintained under stress conditions thanks to the presence of the upstream ORF in transcripts
ABHEB_HUMAN		The protein-lysine deacetylase activity using CoA as substrate is unclear as this protein belongs to a family of serine hydrolases, and that the reaction shown in the publication is not hydrolyzing H(2)O. Additional experiments are therefore required to confirm this activity in vivo
TXD15_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-13 is the initiator
S6A18_HUMAN		The mouse ortholog protein is an active neutral amino acid transporter
NOX5_HUMAN		This isoform was proposed to act as a calcium-dependent proton channel to compensate charge and pH alterations due to electron export; however the channel activity seems to lack strong experimental evidences
OXLA_HUMAN		According to a report, acts as a negative regulator of T-cell activation independently of its enzymatic activity (PubMed:28891065). However, authors of this study only tested enzyme activity via phenylalanine (Phe) deprivation and not via tryptophan (Trp). As IL4I1 immunoregulator activity is mediated via Trp degradation and subsequent activation of the transcription factor AHR, additional experiments are required to confirm this statement (PubMed:32818467, PubMed:32866000)
CRBN_HUMAN		Although it contains a Lon N-terminal domain also found in proteases of the peptidase S16 family, it does not contain the ATP-binding and catalytic domains, suggesting that it has no protease activity
M3K5_HUMAN		Reported to be phosphorylated by AKT2 (PubMed:12697749). However, the publication has been retracted due to image duplication in figures
BARD1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-26 is the initiator
SLX1_HUMAN		Found in a segmental duplication on p arm of chromosome 16 giving rise to two identical copies of this gene sharing exons with SULT1A3 and SULT1A4
FSP1_HUMAN		Conflicting data exist on the pro-apoptotic function of the protein. It was initially claimed that overexpression of FSP1 induces caspase-independent apoptosis, but new evidence disputes this function
G6PC3_HUMAN		According to PubMed:12370122, it has no hydrolytic activity
TLR10_HUMAN		In some plant proteins and in human SARM1, the TIR domain has NAD(+) hydrolase (NADase) activity (By similarity). However, despite the presence of the catalytic Asp residue, the isolated TIR domain of human TLR4 lacks NADase activity (By similarity). Based on this, it is unlikely that Toll-like receptors have NADase activity
STRAB_HUMAN		Ser-184 is present instead of the conserved Asp which is expected to be an active site residue
NDEL1_HUMAN		Was originally thought to function as an oligopeptidase (NUDEL-oligopeptidase or endooligopeptidase A) which could regulate peptide levels relevant to brain function
S22A4_HUMAN		Despite a previous report demonstrating SLC22A4/OCTN1-mediated transport of nucleosides such as the endogenous 2'deoxycytidine or the anticancer drug cytarabine, another study was unable to verify these findings
ABCG8_HUMAN		Seems to have a defective ATP-binding region
PORCN_HUMAN		Was initially thought to mediate palmitoylation of Wnt proteins (PubMed:24292069). It was later shown that instead it acts as a serine O-palmitoleoyltransferase that mediates the attachment of palmitoleate, a 16-carbon monounsaturated fatty acid (C16:1), to Wnt proteins
AL8A1_HUMAN		Originally described as a retinal dehydrogenase based on its ability to preferentially oxidize 9-cis-retinal (PubMed:11007799). It has been reassigned to a 2-aminomuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (PubMed:29703752)
EMRE_HUMAN		A publication reports an opposite topology (PubMed:26774479). However, 3 different articles, 2 in human and one in mouse, confirm the topology shown in this entry (PubMed:27099988, PubMed:27642048)
VIAAT_HUMAN		Juge et al. shows that SLC32A1 is a symporter of both 4-aminobutanoate or glycine or beta-alanine with Cl(-) that operates according an electrical gradient without the need for a chemical gradient (By similarity). However Farsi et al. and Egashira et al. confirm that SLC32A1 is an antiporter that exchanges vesicular protons for cytosolic 4-aminobutanoate or glycine and exclude any coupling with chloride (By similarity)
STEEP_HUMAN		May be duplicated on chromosome 8, within an intron of the ERLIN2 gene
PGES2_HUMAN		It is not known if heme and GST are required for prostaglandin synthase activity. The protein copurifies with heme and GST when DTT is omitted during the purification procedure. The GSH-heme complex-bound enzyme has been proposed to act as a lyase and catalyze the degradation of prostaglandin E2 H2 (PGH2) to 12(S)-hydroxy-5(Z),8(E),10(E)-heptadecatrienoic acid (HHT) and malondialdehyde (MDA). According to PubMed:18198127, boiling the enzyme leads to loss of prostaglandin synthase activity, but does not eliminate the lyase activity. Besides, free heme can catalyze the formation of 12L-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid (HHT) (PubMed:18198127). A more recent study demonstrates the GSH-dependent property of PTGES2, DTT dissociates the bound heme to produce active PGE2 synthase in vitro (By similarity). PTGES2 can only catalyzes PGE2 synthesis in the free state as an enzyme, while in vivo it forms a complex with heme and does not participate in PGE2 synthesis (By similarity). In agreement with this study, the in vivo evidence from PTGES2 deficient mice do not show that this protein is responsible for the PGE2 production under basal or pathophysiological conditions (By similarity)
CERS4_HUMAN		Some prediction bioinformatics tools predict the presence of a homeobox domain (By similarity). However, the domain is degenerate and residues that are important for DNA-binding are absent (By similarity)
IL21_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-8 is the initiator
CHM1A_HUMAN		Was originally (PubMed:8863740) thought to be a metalloprotease (PRSM1). This was based on a wrong translation of the ORF which gave rise to a putative protein of 318 AA containing a pattern reminiscent of zinc metalloproteases
ABCB6_HUMAN		To date, the intracellular localization of ABCB6 is a matter of debate, with conflicting reports suggesting mitochondrial (PubMed:10837493, PubMed:17006453, PubMed:17661442) or endolysosomal localization (PubMed:22655043, PubMed:25627919, PubMed:29940187, PubMed:31053883), therefore questioning the requirement of ABCB6 in the mitochondrial import of porphyrins
ARFG3_HUMAN		Was originally termed ARFGAP1
ALG13_HUMAN		Contains 1 OTU domain with intact active sites. However, no deubiquitinase activity is detected in vitro with this domain compared to other isolated OTU domains
ABCB9_HUMAN		Has also been detected in the endoplasmic reticulum but appears to be a lysosomal protein in vivo
PPA6_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-8 is the initiator
PPA6_HUMAN		Was originally reported to be located in the mitochondrion, but the evidence seems to be weak and contradictory with the presence of a cleaved signal sequence
SCUB2_HUMAN		It is unclear how SCUBE2 binds the dilipidated SHH. According to a report, the SHH cholesterol-anchor, but not palmitate, seems to be both necessary and sufficient for SCUBE2-mediated SHH release from the cell membrane (PubMed:22902404). According to a second paper, palmitoylation accelerates the rate of SCUBE2-mediated release (PubMed:22677548). Cholesterol modification is sufficient for a heterologous protein to bind to SCUBE2 and to be secreted in a SCUBE2-dependent manner (PubMed:22902404)
S52A3_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-5 is the initiator
TIGAR_HUMAN		Not expected to have any kinase activity
SIR7_HUMAN		Was originally termed SIR-T8/SIRT8 (PubMed:11953824). This was later retracted (PubMed:12454780, PubMed:12454781)
GTR9_HUMAN		High-capacity urate transporter that was first described as a fructose and glucose transporter. Also described in the literature as high-affinity and low-capacity glucose and fructose transporter (PubMed:17710649, PubMed:18327257, PubMed:18842065). However, another group could not confirm transporter activity for glucose or fructose (PubMed:28083649)
ETAA1_HUMAN		Initially reported to localize in the cytoplasm (PubMed:16003559). A number of studies showed that it accumulates at DNA damage sites in the nucleus (PubMed:27601467, PubMed:27723717, PubMed:27723720)
CALY_HUMAN		Was originally thought to interact with the D1 dopamine receptor (DRD1) and to play a role in potentiating calcium ion-dependent signaling but this work was later retracted
CALY_HUMAN		In cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), found to be O-glycosylated in the predicted intracellular region at Thr-180 and Thr-189 (PubMed:19838169). This glycosylation has been confirmed by a separate mass spectrometry (MS) method (PubMed:23234360). Glycosylation in this region of the protein is unexplained as yet
FAKD2_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-17 is the initiator
ERAP1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-13 is the initiator
GPC5B_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-9 is the initiator
CWC15_HUMAN		Has been termed C11orf5, but is not the official C11orf5 as defined by HGNC
PK2L1_HUMAN		The active channel complex is an obligate tetramer (PubMed:25820328, PubMed:30004384). In contrast, the isolated cytoplasmic C-terminal domain forms homotrimers in vitro (PubMed:20408813, PubMed:23212381, PubMed:25820328). Likewise, photobleaching experiments suggest formation of homotrimers in the membrane (PubMed:23212381)
PK2L1_HUMAN		PKD1L3 and PKD2L1 have been defined as sour taste receptor in gustatory cells based on a number of indirect evidences in mouse. Some data confirm this hypothesis in human: in 2 patients with sour ageusia that are unresponsive to sour stimuli, but show normal responses to bitter, sweet, and salty stimuli, expression of PKD1L3 and PKD2L1 is absent in the anterior part of the tongue (PubMed:19812697). However, a number of experiments have recently shown that the sour taste receptor activity is probably indirect
TBCD7_HUMAN		Was initially identified as a negative regulator of the TSC-TBC complex (PubMed:17658474). However, it was later shown that TBC1D7 is part of the TSC-TBC complex and participates in GTPase-activating protein activity, leading to inhibition of the TOR signaling cascade (PubMed:22795129). The differences between 2 reports might be explained by experimental conditions in the initial report, in which they overexpressed the TBC1D7 subunit, possibly leading to disrupt the stoichiometric complex and its downstream functions
MYO1A_HUMAN		Represents an unconventional myosin. This protein should not be confused with the conventional myosin-1 (MYH1)
MYO1A_HUMAN		MYO1A mutations have been reported to cause autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss DFNA48 (PubMed:12736868). It was later shown that MYO1A is not associated with DFNA48 (PubMed:24616153)
VPS29_HUMAN		Was originally believed to be a metal-dependent phosphatase but shown to lack catalytic activity; can bind metals with very low affinity suggesting that metal binding is not required for its function
SL9A2_HUMAN		The number, localization and denomination of hydrophobic domains in the Na(+)/H(+) exchangers vary among authors
RF1ML_HUMAN		Was initially thought to promote the termination of non-canonical termination stop codons AGG and AGA in addition to canonical termination codons UAA and UAG (PubMed:20075246). However, it was later shown that termination of non-canonical termination stop codons AGG and AGA is mediated by MTRF1 (PubMed:37141370)
NAT8B_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene. The sequence shown in this entry differs from the translation of the reference genome assembly (GRCh38/hg38) due to two nonsense variants creating stop codons at positions 16 and 168 in the reference genome
PRAF1_HUMAN		In contrast to the mouse ortholog, it does not interact with Ras
HERC5_HUMAN		Was thought to be a ubiquitin ligase ubiquitinated by UBE2D1, but was confirmed by numerous studies that it's main function is as E3 ISG15 ligase
MBD1_HUMAN		Was reported to recruit SETDB1 during DNA replication, to form a S phase-specific complex that would facilitate methylation of H3 'Lys-9' during replication-coupled chromatin assembly and vould be at least composed of the CAF-1 subunit CHAF1A, MBD1 and SETDB1 (PubMed:15327775). The interaction with SETDB1 was also reported to be inhibited by sumoylation at Lys-499 and Lys-538 (PubMed:17066076). However, these papers have been retracted because some data, results and conclusions are not reliable (PubMed:30849389, PubMed:31612521)
MYO6_HUMAN		Represents an unconventional myosin. This protein should not be confused with the conventional myosin-6 (MYH6)
MYO6_HUMAN		Originally predicted to contain a coiled coil domain but generally accepted to contain a stable SAH domain instead
NDRG2_HUMAN		Has some similarity to hydrolases, but lacks the conserved Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad. Has no hydrolase activity towards p-nitrophenylbutyrate (in vitro)
CELA1_HUMAN		In spite of its original name 'Pancreatic elastase 1', CELA1 is not detected in the pancreas. Elastase activity described in the pancreas may be in fact due to CELA2A (PubMed:10620133)
GP132_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a receptor for lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC), However, this work has been retracted
PA2G4_HUMAN		Although it belongs to the peptidase M24 family, it does not contain metal cofactors and lacks aminopeptidase activity
CDYL_HUMAN		Was initially reported to display histone acetyltransferase activity, with a preference for histone H4 (PubMed:12072557). Such activity is however unsure in vivo. Histone acetyltransferase activity would be in contradiction with the function of the protein in corepressor complexes (PubMed:19061646, PubMed:22009739). Moreover, crystallographic studies demonstrated that it does not share any similarity with other acetyltransferases and instead forms a crotonase-like fold (PubMed:19507244)
NOD1_HUMAN		Human and mouse NOD1 bind gamma-D-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid (iE-DAP) in a different context (PubMed:16211083). do not detect the same muropeptide from bacterial peptidoglycan: while human NOD1 detects a tripeptide-containing muropeptide (MurNAc-TriDAP or TriDAP), mouse Nod1 needs a tetrapeptide structure for efficient sensing (MurNAc-tetraDAP or TetraDAP) (PubMed:16211083)
SAC2_HUMAN		INPP5F has been initially described as an inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase
MYH15_HUMAN		Represents a conventional myosin. This protein should not be confused with the unconventional myosin-15 (MYO15)
KAD6_HUMAN		AK6 and TAF9 were initially considered as products of the same gene since they share two exons. However, they are translated from different initiation codons and reading frames and encode unrelated proteins. This arrangement is conserved in some mammalian species
IFT25_HUMAN		Was initially classified as a member of the small heat shock family protein. However, it was later shown that it is not the case (PubMed:19921466)
SNX5_HUMAN		The selectivity for particular phosphatidylinositol lipids is under debate. According to one report (PubMed:19553671), the rat protein binds exclusively to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, while the human protein has been reported (PubMed:15561769) to bind to phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and also to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate
IRAK3_HUMAN		Ser-293 is present instead of the conserved Asp which is expected to be an active site residue. Low level autophosphorylation activity has been reported in PubMed:10383454, while other authors describe this as an inactive kinase
MYH4_HUMAN		Represents a conventional myosin. This protein should not be confused with the unconventional myosin-4 (MYO4)
S23IP_HUMAN		Although belonging to the PA-PL1 family, does not seem to have any phospholipase activity
IGLC7_HUMAN		For an example of a full-length immunoglobulin lambda light chain see AC P0DOX8
PRS37_HUMAN		Although related to peptidase S1 family, lacks the conserved active Ser residue in position 192 which is replaced by an Ala, suggesting that it has no protease activity. Lacks also metal binding sites Glu in position 67 which is replaced by Asn and Asn in position 69 which is replaced by Lys
RCCD1_HUMAN		Postulated to regulate KDM8 histone demethylase activity on di- and trimethylated 'Lys-36' (H3K36me2/me3) of histone H3 (PubMed:24981860). However the demethylase activity of JMJD5 is controversial, as it was later shown to rather act as an endopeptidase that cleaves monomethylated and dimethylated arginine residues of histones H2, H3 and H4. In several studies, JMJD5 was shown not to display any demethylase activity toward methylated H3K36 nor toward other methyllysines in the N-terminal tails of H3 and H4 in vitro (PubMed:28982940)
PGRC1_HUMAN		Was initially identified as sigma-2 receptor, which is thought to play important role in regulating cell survival, morphology and differentiation (PubMed:21730960, PubMed:22292588, PubMed:28007569). However, it was later shown that it is not the case (PubMed:28007569). The sigma-2 receptor has been identified as TMEM97 (AC Q5BJF2) (PubMed:28559337)
CLD4_HUMAN		The intrinsic role of CLDN4 is debated. A function as an inter-claudin regulator has recently been postulated and may well explain both channel-forming and barrier properties inferred by knockout studies
MGST3_HUMAN		Initially it was postulated to be an endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein, but later it was proved by combined proteomic analysis, APEX fingerprinting and confocal and electron microscopy to be localized to the mitochondrion instead
TET3_HUMAN		Subsequent steps in cytosine demethylation are subject to discussion. According to a first model cytosine demethylation occurs through deamination of 5hmC into 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU) and subsequent replacement by unmethylated cytosine by the base excision repair system. According to another model, cytosine demethylation is rather mediated via conversion of 5hmC into 5fC and 5caC, followed by excision by TDG
GRID2_HUMAN		The ligand-gated cation channel activity triggered by glycine and D-serine, first reported in an article, has been a subject of controversy (PubMed:34936451). These findings have been challenged by more recent research (PubMed:39052831)
CIKS_HUMAN		The presence of U-box domain is not predicted by SMART and SWISS-MODEL tools
KDM1A_HUMAN		Was previously reported to interact with ASXL1. However, this publication has been retracted
G37L1_HUMAN		Has been reported to act as a receptor for prosaposin (PSAP) (PubMed:23690594). However, it has also been shown that prosaposin does not increase activity (PubMed:27072655, PubMed:28688853). It has been suggested that GPR37L1 is a constitutively active receptor (PubMed:27072655)
RFIP3_HUMAN		Was initially shown not to interact with ARF5 (PubMed:16148947). Another study later demonstrated the interaction (PubMed:17030804)
DJC13_HUMAN		In human, WASHC2 has undergone evolutionary duplication giving rise to highly homologous family members. A WASHC2C construct with WASHC2A-specific sequence insertions (of 2 aa and 21 aa length resulting in a construct length of 1341 aa similar to WASHC2A length) has been used to demonstrate the interaction with WASHC2 (PubMed:24643499)
PIAS1_HUMAN		A paper showing that PRMT1-mediated arginine methylation of PIAS1 regulates STAT1 signaling has been retracted, because some of the data was found to be deliberately falsified
DDHD2_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-31 is the initiator
FCSD2_HUMAN		The function in endocytosis may depend on the cell type. Plays a role in EGFR endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits in cancer cells, but apparently not in normal cells (PubMed:30249660). A later study used both HeLa cells and BSC1 cells (a C.aethiops kidney cell line), and did not mention any cell-type specific effects (PubMed:29887380)
ATS2_HUMAN		Has sometimes been referred to as ADAMTS3
YETS4_HUMAN		According to a report, recognizes and binds histone H3 succinylated at 'Lys-122' (H3K122succ) (PubMed:29463709). However, another report only observed poor binding with succinylated histone H3 (PubMed:30071723)
PX11B_HUMAN		PubMed:9792670 states that both the N- and the C-terminus are located in the cytoplasm
HPTR_HUMAN		Although homologous to serine proteases, it has lost all essential catalytic residues and has no enzymatic activity

HLAH_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene
APOA2_HUMAN		A paper describing the crystal structure of this protein has been retracted due to evidence of fabricated data (see also US Office of Research Integrity Notice 2018-07782)
K2C1_HUMAN		A peptide corresponding to residues 278 to 289 was isolated as part of plant proteomics studies and was originally thought to be of plant origin (PubMed:16529377, PubMed:18602030, PubMed:19412582). However, it was later shown that it is likely to be human type II keratin, a common contaminant in proteomic analyzes (PubMed:23895828)
HMGB1_HUMAN		Inconsistent experimental results may reflect the use of inconsistently defined redox forms. A recombinant fully reduced form has been used in a number of experiments. However, the redox states of HMGB1 administered in vivo, may interconvert among each other. Purified HMGB1 by itself has only weak pro-inflammatory activity
IGLC1_HUMAN		For an example of a full-length immunoglobulin lambda light chain see AC P0DOX8
IGLC2_HUMAN		For an example of a full-length immunoglobulin lambda light chain see AC P0DOX8
H3Y2_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene
AMY1C_HUMAN		Three distinct genes (AMY1A, AMY1B and AMY1C), located in a gene cluster on 1p21, encode proteins sharing the same peptidic sequence
TRAR2_HUMAN		This sequence is an example of a full-length TR alpha chain. Pan-cancer TRAV38-2DV8*01J31*01C*01 TR alpha chain is generated by somatic recombination of variable TRAV38-2DV8 (AC A0JD32) and joining TRAJ31 (AC A0A075B700) gene segments spliced to constant TRAC (AC P01848) gene segment
GRAA_HUMAN		Exons 1a and 1b of the sequence reported in PubMed:17180578 are of human origin, however exon 2 shows strong similarity to the rat sequence
HGF_HUMAN		Has lost two of the three essential catalytic residues and so probably has no enzymatic activity
HIS3_HUMAN		Hst 5 uptake into the pathogen cell by direct transfer across the membrane causing cell death has been questioned (PubMed:20487276). Moreover, endocytic vacuolar uptake was showed to be insignificant in terms of Hst 5 toxicity (PubMed:20487276)
PRPS3_HUMAN		According to PubMed:2168892, this sequence initiates from a non-AUG codon; N-terminal ACG codon did serve as a start codon
ENPP1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-53 is the initiator
PROZ_HUMAN		Although related to peptidase S1 family vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, it has lost two of the essential catalytic residues and therefore lacks protease activity
PPIB_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-9 is the initiator
OMGP_HUMAN		Do not confuse oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein (OMG) with myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)
CALR_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be the 52 kDa Ro autoantigen
PSB4_HUMAN		A report observed N-glycosylation at Asn-83 (PubMed:19139490). However, as the protein does not localize in an extracellular compartment of the cell, additional evidence is required to confirm this result
ABCD3_HUMAN		Mutation in ABCD3 have been found in two individuals affected by Zellweger syndrome (PubMed:1301993). Later studies, however, showed unambiguously that a PEX1 defect was the underlying cause of the defect in peroxisome biogenesis in these patients (PubMed:9539740)
CYTD_HUMAN		The truncated forms found may result from N-terminal proteolysis
ERCC5_HUMAN		A paper describing an additional role for this protein in a base excision repair pathway that is not coupled to transcription has been retracted, because some of the experimental data were incorrect
CXB2_HUMAN		The role of Thr-34 and Ile-37 variants in deafness was unclear (PubMed:14694360, PubMed:16849369, PubMed:17935238, PubMed:9139825, PubMed:9422505). However, their pathogenicity has been definitely confirmed (PubMed:31160754)
HXD3_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-17 is the initiator
CP2CJ_HUMAN		P450-254C was originally listed as a separate gene (CYP2C17). Resequencing demonstrated that it is not a separate gene, but a chimera. The 5'-portion corresponds to a partial 2C18 clone, and the 3'-portion corresponds to a partial 2C19 clone
RYK_HUMAN		According to some authors, has impaired kinase activity
IL13_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-15 is the initiator
K1C9_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a 60 kDa chain of placental scatter protein

CEAM6_HUMAN		Described to function in anoikis resistance and to be up-regulated in anoikis-resistant pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells in an article that was finally retracted
STA5A_HUMAN		It was reported that dephosphorylation on tyrosine residues by PTPN2 would negatively regulate prolactin signaling pathway (PubMed:11773439). However, the corresponding article has been retracted (PubMed:24319783)
TXK_HUMAN		Unlike the other TEC subfamily members, TXK is activated independently of the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, consistent with its lack of a PH domain. Membrane association is performed through palmitoylation at the N-terminus
PI2R_HUMAN		Palmitoylation of either Cys-308 or Cys-311 was reported to be sufficient to maintain functional coupling to G(s) proteins and signaling (PubMed:12488443). However, this publication was retracted due to figure duplication
MAGA3_HUMAN		In vitro experiments measuring cell viability in melanoma cell lines used siRNA specific for MAGEA3 and MAGEA6
UCRI_HUMAN		Several peptides are generated during UQCRFS1 insertion (PubMed:28673544). According to some authors, the identification of the transit peptide as the subunit 9, does not necessary imply that it must be considered as a structural subunit of the complex III dimer as additional fragments from UQCRFS1 are also present (PubMed:28673544)
NRAM2_HUMAN		The capacity to transport copper ions remains controversial
SPS1_HUMAN		The conserved active site Cys (or selenocysteine) residue in position 29 is replaced by a Thr. However, as function in selenoprotein synthesis is proven, it is possible Cys-31 is the active site
R144A_HUMAN		Lacks the His residue in the RING-type domain 2 that is one of the conserved features of the family
CCR6_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-6 is the initiator
UBP11_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-44 is the initiator
TDGF3_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene. The CRIPTO3 locus has characteristics of a retrotransposon, including lack of introns and a poly(A) sequence
ROA3_HUMAN		An older version of this entry represented the conceptual translation of what was thought to be HNRNPA3 but which was in fact a pseudogene (HNRPA3P1/FBRNP) located on chromosome 10
NUDT6_HUMAN		The rat protein was reported to play a role in DNA repair (PubMed:9406864), based on its ability to complement E.coli deficient in the DNA repair enzyme mutT that hydrolyzes oxidized guanine nucleotides. PubMed:17569023 found no such activity, neither for the human nor the rat protein
DSRAD_HUMAN		The N-terminus of isoform 4 has been derived from EST and genomic sequences
PRS10_HUMAN		Alternative initiation from an upstream conserved methionine cannot be fully excluded but is not experimentally supported while initiation from the displayed methionine is supported by PubMed:17323924
RS32_HUMAN		There are multiple pseudogenes of this gene dispersed through the genome
RAC1_HUMAN		The interaction between DSCAM, PAK1 and RAC1 has been described. This article has been withdrawn by the authors
VAMP2_HUMAN		A structure of a fragment of this protein in complex with the catalytic domain of C.botulinum neurotoxin type B (BoNT/B, botB) was reported; because of the lack of clear and continuous electron density for the VAMP2 peptide in the complex structure, the paper was retracted (PubMed:10932255, PubMed:19578378). However this protein is a substrate for BoNT/B (PubMed:22289120, PubMed:7803399)
H31_HUMAN		The original paper reporting lysine deamination at Lys-5 by LOXL2 has been retracted due to inappropriate manipulation of figure data (PubMed:22483618, PubMed:27392148). However, this modification was confirmed in a subsequent publication (PubMed:27735137)
HBB_HUMAN		The modification form of Leu-142 is subject of controversy and could be the artifactual result of sample handling
HBB_HUMAN		It is unclear if hemoglobin Beckman (Hb Beckman) is defined by p.Ala136Glu or p.Ala136Asp. Hb Beckman has been originally identified by reverse phase-HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry, and has been reported as variant p.Ala136Glu (Ref.140). Subsequently, variant p.Ala136Asp has been reported based on HBB gene complete sequencing results (PubMed:19453576). Variant p.Ala136Asp has also been detected by mass spectrometry (PubMed:26209877). Although the name Hb Beckman is currently used for variant p.Ala136Asp, it cannot be ruled out that Hb Beckman is indeed variant p.Ala136Glu (PubMed:19453576)
LV321_HUMAN		For an example of a full-length immunoglobulin lambda light chain see AC P0DOX8
ATL3_HUMAN		Although strongly similar to members of the ADAMTS family it lacks the metalloprotease and disintegrin-like domains which are typical of that family
LACTB_HUMAN		Was originally identified as mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit protein mL56 (MRP-L56) (PubMed:11551941), but has since been shown to localize to the mitochondrial intermembrane space where it forms filaments (PubMed:19858488)
XIAP_HUMAN		Was originally shown to be phosphorylated at Ser-87 by PKB, protecting the protein from ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (PubMed:14645242). However, this work was later retracted (PubMed:27825084)
TLE4_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-8 is the initiator
EGR4_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-104 is the initiator. Some orthologous sequences cannot be extended
AOXA_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a xanthine dehydrogenase
PPID_HUMAN		This protein should not be confused with mitochondrial peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase F (PPIF) which is often referred to as cyclophilin D or CypD
WASC5_HUMAN		One study reported a nucleation-promoting factor (NPF) activity towards the Arp2/3 complex using partially purified samples of the WASH complex (PubMed:19922875). In another study, the in vitro reconstituted and purified recombinant WASH core complex, consisting of WASHC3, WASHC4, WASHC5, WASHC1 and the N-terminal residues 1-356 of WASHC2, did not show activity toward Arp2/3 complex (PubMed:20498093)
CDC20_HUMAN		Originally thought to be phosphorylated by MPF during mitosis. However this paper was retracted due to falsification of data
IRAG2_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-57 is the initiator methionine. However, according to PubMed:8021504, the initiator methionine is coded by a non-canonical CTG leucine codon; This leucine codon is in an excellent Kozak consensus located 39 bp upstream of the corresponding first mouse ATG
PTPRJ_HUMAN		Originally thought to dephosphorylate RET. However this paper was retracted due to manipulation of immunoblot data
TRAF2_HUMAN		Was reported to interact with IL15RA (PubMed:10463949). However, this work was later retracted (PubMed:21357251)
UBP4_HUMAN		The ubiquitin-like domain 2 was thought to interact with the catalytic domain competing with the ubiquitin substrate and thus partially inhibiting USP4 activity (PubMed:21415856). As the results could not be reproduced this work was later retracted (PubMed:24398133). The cristal structure in the paper was correct and was republished later (PubMed:25404403)
RED_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be the IK factor, a cytokine involved in the negative regulatory pathway of constitutive MHC class II antigens expression
PPIL2_HUMAN		Despite the fact that it belongs to the cyclophilin-type PPIase family, a report has shown that it has probably no peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity due to the presence of a tyrosine instead of a tryptophan at position 389
U119A_HUMAN		According to some authors, acts by extracting target proteins from membranes (PubMed:21642972). According to a another report, rather acts by targeting proteins to membranes (PubMed:22085962)
ITPK1_HUMAN		PubMed:11533064 detected some protein kinase activity and ability to phosphorylate transcription factors c-jun/JUN and ATF2. However, PubMed:15762844 showed that it does not have protein kinase activity
APOF_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-12 is the initiator
ENR1_HUMAN		CKS-17 sequence does not match the minimal active consensus
ENR1_HUMAN		Truncated; premature stop codon upstream of the fusion peptide on TM
KI2S1_HUMAN		The KIR2DS1 gene is not directly represented on the GRCh38 primary reference genome assembly but on alternate loci of that assembly
PMVK_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be located in the peroxisome (PubMed:10191291). However, was later shown to be cytosolic (PubMed:14729858, PubMed:27052676)
ERBB4_HUMAN		Conflicting reports about the role of ERBB4 in mediating apoptosis, differentiation, or tumor cell proliferation may be explained by the opposite functions of the different isoforms and their intracellular fragments, and by the formation of heterodimers with other EGF receptor family members (PubMed:18454307, PubMed:21811097). Thus, heterodimer formation of a kinase-dead ERBB4 mutant with ERBB2 is sufficient for the activation of AKT1, MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1 (PubMed:19098003)
SHH_HUMAN		The several steps and mechanisms that permit controlled Shh dispersion and gradient formation remain controversial. The ShhNC C-terminal domain displays an autoproteolysis activity and a cholesterol transferase activity resulting in the cleavage and covalent attachment of a cholesterol moiety to the C-terminal of the newly generated N-terminal fragment (ShhN). The protein is further modified by covalent addition of palmitate at the N-terminal of ShhN, resulting to the dual-lipidated Shh (ShhNp). ShhNp is firmly tethered to the cell membrane where it forms multimers. Further solubilization and release from the cell surface seem to be achieved through different mechanisms, including the interaction with DISP1 and SCUBE2, movement by lipoprotein particles, transport by cellular extensions called cytonemes or by proteolytic removal of both terminal lipidated peptides (PubMed:26875496). Once released, the fully processed Shh can signal within embryonic tissues both at short and long-range
TRBP2_HUMAN		A paper describing truncating mutations of TARBP2 in tumor cells and resultant effects on DICER1 stability and miRNA processing has been retracted, due to concerns of image duplication in some of the figures
C19L2_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-5 is the initiator
KRA63_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-8 is the initiator
AR13B_HUMAN		Was initially thought to form a homodimer (PubMed:18554500). However, 3D structure of C.reinhardtii ortholog showed that it is probably not the case
T10IP_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-7 is the initiator
VMA21_HUMAN		Protein characterization data are from PubMed:19379691. Due to a number of errors in the figure panels, the article has been retracted but the authors stand by the validity of the main results and conclusions (PubMed:20873370)
ANO6_HUMAN		Contains ten transmembrane regions, not eight as predicted
UBP39_HUMAN		Lacks the conserved His and Cys residues that are essential for the activity of de-ubiquitinating enzymes. Lacks ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase activity (PubMed:18728397)
CCD92_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-18 is the initiator
SGMR2_HUMAN		The molecular identity of the sigma-2 receptor has been unclear for a long time. It is now identified as TMEM97 (PubMed:28559337). Previously identified as PGRMC1 (AC O00264) (PubMed:22292588, PubMed:28007569)
RHG21_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-2 is the initiator
RN187_HUMAN		This sequence initiates at a CTG codon
CE162_HUMAN		Was initially thought to regulate chromosome segregation and mitotic spindle assembly (PubMed:16302001). However, it was later shown that its absence neither affect mitosis nor centriole duplication (PubMed:23644468)
STEA3_HUMAN		Was initially thought to have tumor suppressor function in prostate cancer. However, it was shown that it is probably not the case (PubMed:12866033)
TTC19_HUMAN		Was reported to be required for the abscission step in cytokinesis, possibly regulating the ESCRT-III complex via its interaction with CHMP4B (PubMed:20208530). According to the same authors, localizes to the centrosome during all stages of the cell cycle and is recruited to the midbody during cytokinesis (PubMed:20208530). However, the midbody localization could not be confirmed by others (PubMed:21278747)
H2B2C_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene. In contrast to other H2B histones, it does not contain the conserved residue in C-terminus that is the target of monoubiquitination
ELP2_HUMAN		The elongator complex was originally thought to play a role in transcription elongation. However, it is no longer thought to play a direct role in this process and its primary function is thought to be in tRNA modification
TNG2_HUMAN		Previous published data showed conflicting results on the intracellular location of TANGO2. Has been reported to be located in the Golgi apparatus (PubMed:26805781). However, another study was unable to detect Golgi localization (PubMed:32909282). Has been reported to be located in the mitochondrion by several recent studies (PubMed:32909282, PubMed:35197517, PubMed:36961129). However, no mitochondrial localization was detected in a study which reported that the protein is primarily cytoplasmic (PubMed:31276219)
TET2_HUMAN		Subsequent steps in cytosine demethylation are subject to discussion. According to a first model cytosine demethylation occurs through deamination of 5hmC into 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU) and subsequent replacement by unmethylated cytosine by the base excision repair system. According to another model, cytosine demethylation is rather mediated via conversion of 5hmC into 5fC and 5caC, followed by excision by TDG (PubMed:21817016)
FAP20_HUMAN		According to a report, ubiquitin-binding is dispensable for function (PubMed:22396592). However, such data are not confirmed by PubMed:22705371
MYO7B_HUMAN		Represents an unconventional myosin. This protein should not be confused with the conventional myosin-7 (MYH7)
U17L2_HUMAN		The RS447 megasatellite DNA is a highly polymorphic conserved tandem repetitive sequence which contains a copy of the USP17 gene. It is present with an interindividual variation in copy number, ranging from 20 to 103, and can be found in the genome both on chromosome 4 and chromosome 8. USP17 is also frequently named DUB3 in the literature. The high similarity between the UPS17-like genes makes impossible to clearly assign data to one of the genes of the family. Oligonucleotides designed in RNAi experiments are for instance not specific of a given UPS17-like gene
BRWD3_HUMAN		The translocation involving this gene was originally published as t(X;11)(q13;23), but BRWD3 is localized to Xq21 and not to Xq13
S4A10_HUMAN		Has been shown to act as a sodium/bicarbonate cotransporter in exchange for intracellular chloride (By similarity). Has also been shown to act as a sodium/biocarbonate cotransporter which is not responsible for net efflux of chloride, with the observed chloride efflux being due to chloride self-exchange (PubMed:18319254)
PRS55_HUMAN		Controversial data exist concerning the topology of PRSS55. One study in mouse shows that PRS55 is a GPI-anchored protein (By similarity). An other study does not confirm the GPI-anchor status of PRSS55 (PubMed:18844450). However as a GPI-anchor motif is detected, the possibility of a GPI-anchor instead of a single-pass type I membrane protein is probable
ALKL2_HUMAN		It is unclear whether it activates ALK as a homodimer or a monomer (PubMed:34646012, PubMed:34819673). According to a report, homodimeric ALKAL2 activates ALK (PubMed:34819673). According to a second publication, monomeric ALKAL2 binds and activates ALK (PubMed:34646012)
ATL4_HUMAN		Although similar to members of the ADAMTS family, it lacks the metalloprotease and disintegrin-like domains which are typical of that family
PAXI1_HUMAN		The terminology of MLL proteins in mammalia is not consistent also concerning the terminology of MLL protein-containing complexes. The decribed MLL2/MLL3 complex is commonly described as MLL3/MLL4 complex in literature
TAOK1_HUMAN		Was initially thought to play a role in the spindle checkpoint (PubMed:17417629). However, it was later shown that it is not the case and that phenotypes initially observed are the cause of the siRNA used that has an off-target effect resulting in MAD2L1 inhibition (PubMed:19904549, PubMed:20162290)
S29A4_HUMAN		Unlike mouse protein, not able to transport adenine nucleotide in acidic condition
CTSR4_HUMAN		In mouse, Slco6c1 is an additional auxiliary subunit of the CatSper complex. It is unclear if the related SLCO6A1 protein performs the same role in non-rodent species
PK1L2_HUMAN		PKD1L2 is both a gene and a pseudogene in the human population. The reference genome assembly corresponds currently to the non-functional allele while the sequence shown here is the one of the functional protein
YTHD3_HUMAN		Was initially reported to act as a regulator of mRNA translation efficiency in cooperation with YTHDF1 by binding to m6A-containing mRNAs and interacting with 40S and 60S ribosome subunits (PubMed:28106072, PubMed:28106076, PubMed:28281539). These studies suggested that the 3 different paralogs (YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3) have unique functions with limited redundancy (PubMed:28106072, PubMed:28106076, PubMed:28281539). However, later studies showed that YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3 paralogs have redundant functions to a profound extent and directly promote degradation of m6A-containing mRNAs (PubMed:32492408). The effect on translation efficiency observed earlier is probably indirect (PubMed:32492408)
C163A_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-6 is the initiator
PTOV1_HUMAN		Despite sequence similarity to MED25, to date this protein has not been identified as a component of the Mediator complex
TMPS6_HUMAN		A study described a function as serine protease towards extracellular matrix proteins in the liver; however, this article was later retracted
HUNIN_HUMAN		The humanin peptide described here has been shown to be biologically active but is the product of a mitochondrial gene, MT-RNR2 (PubMed:12009529). If translation of the mRNA occurs in the mitochondrion rather than in the cytoplasm, then the usage of the mitochondrial genetic code would lead to the production of a shorter peptide lacking the last three C-terminal residues. The mechanisms allowing the production and the secretion of humanin remain unclear. The possibility exists that the physiologically active humanin peptide is encoded by one of the related genes present in the nuclear genome (PubMed:19477263)
NALCN_HUMAN		NALCN was also originally reported to be a voltage-independent, cation-nonselective channel which is permeable to sodium, potassium and calcium ions (PubMed:17448995). However, NALCN is recently reported to be selective only for monovalent cations and to be blocked by extracellular divalent cations (PubMed:32494638). Futhemore, coexpression of NALCN, UNC79, UNC80, and NALF1 results in voltage-dependent NALCN currents (PubMed:31409833, PubMed:32494638)
ABCA7_HUMAN		There are conflicting results concerning the role of ABCA7 in lipid transport. ABCA7 was described to play a role in apolipoprotein-mediated phospholipid and cholesterol efflux when expressed in HEK293 cells (PubMed:12917409, PubMed:27472885). However, another report shows that ABCA7 deficiency does not influence cholesterol and phospholipid efflux in mouse primary macrophages, but leads to lower serum HDL cholesterol levels and a reduction in fat mass in female mice (By similarity)
STAG2_HUMAN		Variants MKMS 743-Trp--Phe-1231 DEL and HPE13 1033-Arg--Phe-1231 DEL were previously described; however, the corresponding paper has been retracted as Case 1's sex was incorrectly reported invalidating the conclusions
CERS5_HUMAN		Some prediction bioinformatics tools predict the presence of a homeobox domain (By similarity). However, the domain is degenerate and residues that are important for DNA-binding are absent (By similarity)
ENDOV_HUMAN		Was initially characterized as an endodeoxyribonuclease involved in DNA repair (PubMed:22664237). While it shows some weak endodeoxyribonuclease activity in vitro, such activity probably does not exist in vivo
RDH13_HUMAN		Was originally thought to lack retinol dehydrogenase (RDH) activity. However, a more recent publication demonstrates a retinol dehydrogenase activity for RDH13
PAPD5_HUMAN		Was originally thought to have DNA polymerase activity
CTSR1_HUMAN		In mouse, Slco6c1 is an additional auxiliary subunit of the CatSper complex. It is unclear if the related SLCO6A1 protein performs the same role in non-rodent species
PDZD8_HUMAN		(Microbial infection) Was initially reported to enhance infectivity of retroviruses, such as HIV-1, by stabilizing the capsid of retroviruses (PubMed:20573829, PubMed:24554657). However, it was later shown that PDZD8 is not absolutely required for HIV-1 infection, suggesting that its role in retroviral infection is probably indirect (PubMed:25771112)
FLCN_HUMAN		Based on its structure and in vitro assays, was initially thought to have guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity (PubMed:22977732). However, subsequent studies showed that it does not act as GEF in vivo (PubMed:24095279)
TET1_HUMAN		Subsequent steps in cytosine demethylation are subject to discussion. According to a first model cytosine demethylation occurs through deamination of 5hmC into 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU) and subsequent replacement by unmethylated cytosine by the base excision repair system (PubMed:21496894). According to another model, cytosine demethylation is rather mediated via conversion of 5hmC into 5fC and 5caC, followed by excision by TDG and replacement by unmethylated cytosine
GDAP1_HUMAN		While belonging to the GST superfamily, it lacks glutathione transferase activity
AT2L1_HUMAN		Does not seem to possess aminotransferase activity
PLPR1_HUMAN		Has no 2-lysophosphatidate/LPA phosphatase activity. This is supported by the fact that the phosphatase sequence motifs as well as the His residue acting as a nucleophile in active phosphatases of the PA-phosphatase related phosphoesterase family are not conserved
HAVR2_HUMAN		Experimental results based on the injection of HAVCR2/TIM-3 antibodies or use of HAVCR2/TIM-3-Fc fusion proteins can reflect changes in the activity of several cell types and pathways as HAVCR2/TIM-3 is expressed by multiple immune cell types
S22AH_HUMAN		The protein uses an unusual AUG start codon with leucine. Ribosome profiling data indicate that translation initiates from the non-AUG (CTG) codon used here
ZDH19_HUMAN		Was shown to mediate palmitoylation of STAT3, leading to homodimerization and transcriptional activation of STAT3. However, this study was later retracted
PALLD_HUMAN		Was wrongly assigned as myoneurin (Ref.2)
ATRIP_HUMAN		The gene for this protein is either identical to or adjacent to that of TREX1. Some of the mRNAs that encode ATRIP also encode TREX1 in another reading frame
BACD1_HUMAN		Baed on animal models in mouse and zebrafish, it was suggested that KCTD13 is the major factor inducing the macrocephaly phenotype associated with the 16p11.2 deletion (PubMed:22596160). However, a subsequent report showed that KCTD13 does not play a role in brain size
BAP1_HUMAN		According to a report, interaction with FOXK2 is not dependent on phosphorylation of BAP1 (PubMed:24748658). However, it was later shown that phosphorylation at Thr-493 promotes interaction with FOXK2 (PubMed:25451922)
SL9A6_HUMAN		Was originally (PubMed:9507001) identified as a mitochondrial inner membrane protein, but was later shown to be localized in early and recycling endosomes and not mitochondria (PubMed:11641397, PubMed:11940519)
LGAT1_HUMAN		The role in phosphatidylglycerols remodeling and cardiolipin synthesis is questioned as both processes occur in mitochondria. The monoacylglycerol acyltransferase activity is also weak and a direct role in triacylglycerol synthesis appears unlikely
DDX17_HUMAN		Was reported to act as a transcriptional coactivator for estrogen receptor ESR1 (PubMed:11250900). Although this publication was retracted because of aberrations in some figures, this function was also described in other publications by different groups and may be real (PubMed:19995069, PubMed:20406972, PubMed:20663877, PubMed:24275493)
KAT5_HUMAN		The role of the Tudor-knot domain, also named chromo barrel or chromodomain, is unclear. Based on its similarity with some chromo domains, it was first reported to bind histone H3 trimethylated on 'Lys-4' and/or 'Lys-9' (H3K4me3 and/or H3K9me3, respectively) (PubMed:19783983, PubMed:25560918). However, another group was not able to see any binding to methylated histones (PubMed:29494751). The 3D structure of the domain suggests that the inability to bind histones is caused by occlusion of the putative peptide-binding site by a basic amino acid side chain within a unique beta hairpin (PubMed:29494751)
PLD4_HUMAN		Exhibits no phospholipase activity, despite two HKD motifs
TIFA_HUMAN		D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose 1,7-bisphosphate (HBP) was initially thought to constitute the bacterial pathogen-associated molecular pattern metabolite (PAMP) triggering the ALPK1-TIFA innate immunune response (PubMed:26068852, PubMed:28222186, PubMed:28877472). It was however shown that ADP-D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose (ADP-Heptose) constitutes the main PAMP that activates the kinase activity of ALPK1, promoting phosphorylation of TIFA (PubMed:30111836)
THOC3_HUMAN		There are two almost identical copies of this gene on chromosome 5q35. One copy is frameshifted and unlikely to encode a functional protein
EHMT2_HUMAN		While NG36 and G9a were originally thought to derive from 2 separate genes, all G9A transcripts also contain the in frame coding sequence of NG36
EHMT2_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-21 is the initiator methionine
JSPR1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-3 is the initiator
OXGR1_HUMAN		Was originally (Ref.5) thought to be a P2Y receptor
PEO1_HUMAN		The N-terminus contains a putative primase-like domain; however the absence of the zinc binding domain and other motifs important for catalysis suggests that TWNK lacks primase activity
PEO1_HUMAN		In vitro, can catalyze the hydrolysis of different nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) substrates with different efficiency
PARK7_HUMAN		Glyoxalase activity has been reported (PubMed:22523093, PubMed:31653696). It may however reflect its deglycase activity (PubMed:25416785)
PARK7_HUMAN		The protein deglycation activity is controversial. It has been ascribed to a TRIS buffer artifact by a publication (PubMed:27903648) and as a result of the removal of methylglyoxal by glyoxalase activity that leads to a subsequent decomposition of hemithioacetals and hemianimals due to the shift in equilibrium position by another one (PubMed:31653696). However, biochemical experiments showing that PARK7 is a bona fide deglycase have been performed (PubMed:25416785, PubMed:28013050, PubMed:28596309)
ANM1_HUMAN		A paper showing that PRMT1-mediated arginine methylation of PIAS1 regulates STAT1 signaling has been retracted, because some of the data was found to be deliberately falsified
E2AK1_HUMAN		Was reported to be expressed predominantly in erythroid cells and at much lower levels in hepatocytes. However, this paper has been retracted because there was improper manipulation, reuse and analyses
TIRR_HUMAN		Although strongly related to the nudix NUDT16 protein, lacks the Nudix box and is therefore not related to the rest of the family (PubMed:18820299, PubMed:21070968). Gene organization and evolutionary distribution suggest that syndesmos NUDT16L1 probably originated as a gene duplication event of the more ancient U8 snoRNA-decapping enzyme NUDT16 (PubMed:18820299). Although similar to U8 snoRNA-decapping enzyme NUDT16, lacks a number of residues which are necessary for hydrolase activity and does not play a role in U8 snoRNA decapping activity (PubMed:21070968)
DHRS6_HUMAN		Postulated to act as a 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, however its contribution to ketone body formation appears to be physiologically irrelevant since it has very low affinity for the substrate
TR61B_HUMAN		The identity of the enzyme catalyzing mitochondrial mRNA N(1)-methyltransferase is unclear. According to a report, mitochondrial mRNA N(1)-methyltransferase activity is catalyzed by TRMT61B (PubMed:29107537). According to a second report, it is mediated by TRMT10C (AC Q7L0Y3) (PubMed:29072297). As both reports only tested one protein (either TRMT61B or TRMT10C), it is possible that both proteins have this activity
EIF2A_HUMAN		This gene should not be confused with EIF2S1, frequently called eIF2-alpha in the literature, and with which it shares the alias EIF2A. EIF2S1 is the alpha subunit of the eIF2 translation initiation complex. Although both of these proteins function in binding initiator tRNA to the 40S ribosomal subunit, the EIF2A protein does so in a codon-dependent manner, whereas eIF2 complex requires GTP. Was initially thought to constitute the ortholog of prokaryotic IF-2 (infB) protein
TRI55_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-17 is the initiator
EGLN1_HUMAN		It was previously reported that this protein was the ortholog of rat SM-20. However, EGLN3 is now considered the true ortholog of rat SM-20 since it shows substantially greater similarity
ISCU_HUMAN		Previous publications report that ISCU could provide the architecture on which both [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters could be assembled (PubMed:16517407, PubMed:16527810, PubMed:23940031). Recent reports confirm that only [2Fe-2S] clusters are formed by the core ISC assembly complex (PubMed:34824239)
GBA3_HUMAN		The sequence shown in this entry differs from the translation of the reference genome assembly (GRCh38/hg38) due to a nonsense variant creating stop codon at position 456 in the reference genome
GO45_HUMAN		Was originally identified as a potential transcription factor, because of the presence of a potential basic motif and leucine-zipper domain, and because isoform 1 is detected in the nucleus upon heterologous expression. However, homology at several typical position for basic or hydrophobic residues is missing. Besides, another publication showed it is important for normal Golgi apparatus structure and function
MTRFR_HUMAN		In contrast to other members of the family, lacks the regions that come into close contact with the mRNA in the ribosomal A-site and determine the STOP codon specificity, suggesting a loss of codon specificity for translation release factor activity
NELFA_HUMAN		PubMed:12612062 has shown that it is not involved in Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome
SR5A3_HUMAN		Was initially characterized as a polyprenol reductase, mediating the conversion of polyprenol into dolichol (PubMed:20637498). However, it was later shown to catalyze an intermediate step in this pathway and reduce polyprenal (PubMed:38821050)
NMRL1_HUMAN		Lacks the conserved Tyr residue in the active site triad of Ser-Tyr-Lys necessary for dehydrogenase activity, suggesting that it has no oxidoreductase activity
TPC_HUMAN		Previously identified as the mitochondrial deoxyribonucleotide carrier (PubMed:11226231). However other experiments later demonstrated that SLC25A19 is a thiamine diphosphate transporter and not a mitochondrial deoxyribonucleotide carrier (PubMed:15539640, PubMed:18280798)
MET14_HUMAN		The effect of phosphorylation at Ser-399 is unclear. According to a report, phosphorylation at Ser-399 is important for interaction with METTL3: phosphorylated Ser-399 forms a salt bridge with 'Arg-471' of METTL3 (PubMed:27281194). According to another report, phosphorylation at Ser-399 does not affect interaction with METTL3 (PubMed:29348140)
MET14_HUMAN		The ability of METTL14 to have catalytic activity is unclear and a number of experimental evidence suggests that it has no methyltransferase activity by itself (PubMed:27281194, PubMed:27373337, PubMed:27627798). According to some reports, has some methyltransferase activity in vitro (PubMed:24316715). However, other studies showed that METTL14 constitutes the RNA-binding scaffold that recognizes the substrate rather than the catalytic core (PubMed:27281194, PubMed:27373337, PubMed:27627798). 3D-structure studies showed that METTL14 contains a degenerate active site that is unable to accommodate donor and acceptor substrates (PubMed:27627798)
MET14_HUMAN		A disulfide bond between Cys-338 and Cys-388 is observed in a structure (PubMed:27627798). Its existence is however unsure in vivo
S40A1_HUMAN		Manganese Mn(2+) transport by SLC40A1 remains controversial. Some in vitro studies have suggested that SLC40A1 transports minimal amounts of Mn(2+) (PubMed:22178646, PubMed:30247984). Other groups have suggested that it does not (PubMed:24304836, PubMed:29792530). The affinity of SLC40A1 for Mn(2+) is extremely low compared with iron, implying that any SLC40A1-mediated Mn(2+) transport in vivo would likely be trivial (PubMed:24304836). A recent study examined the role of SLC40A1 in Mn(2+) homeostasis by using Tmprss6-O mice, which express high levels of hepcidin/HAMP and therefore have very low SLC40A1 levels in their tissues. These mice show frank iron deficiency and reduced iron levels in most tissues, but manganese levels are largely unaffected (By similarity). These studies suggest that manganese is propably not the physiological substrate of SLC40A1
FGF20_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether variants in this gene are associated with Parkinson disease. Some authors mention association with the disease (PubMed:18252210). In contrast, some others do not observe any association (PubMed:19133659)
INCE_HUMAN		PubMed:11139336 experiments have been carried out partly in chicken and partly in human
INCE_HUMAN		Originally predicted to contain a coiled coil domain but shown to contain a stable SAH domain instead
EXOS5_HUMAN		The six exosome core subunits containing a RNase PH-domain are not phosphorolytically active
PRDC1_HUMAN		Lacks the conserved active site Asp and has no significant phosphoribosyltransferase activity
TREX1_HUMAN		The gene for this protein is either identical to or adjacent to that of ATRIP. Some of the mRNAs that encode ATRIP also encode TREX1 in another reading frame
EXD2_HUMAN		Subcellular location is subject to discussion. Different publications report a mitochondrial localization (PubMed:29335528, PubMed:29599527, PubMed:31127291). According to some reports, tranlocates to the nucleus in response of DNA damage (PubMed:26807646, PubMed:31255466). However, according to another publication, DNA damage does not result in nuclear translocation (PubMed:31127291). Its precise localization in mitochondrion is also controversial (PubMed:29335528, PubMed:29599527, PubMed:31127291). Two different groups report a localization to the mitochondrial outer membrane, which is consistent with the presence of a N-terminal transmembrane region (PubMed:29599527, PubMed:31127291). In contrast, a publication reports localization to the mitochondrial matrix; protease accessibility used in this assay can however lead to misinterpretation if the target protein is unexpectedly resistant to proteases (PubMed:29335528). Mechanisms that explain its dual role in mitochondrion and nuclear DNA repair are unknown and additional evidences are needed to reconciliate these two apparently incompatible functions
F86C1_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene
QPCTL_HUMAN		It is unclear whether this protein requires a metal cofactor for catalysis. It was originally proposed to be a Zn(2+)-dependent metalloenzyme based on structural similarities to bacterial aminopeptidases and the observation that it can bind Zn(2+) ions, typically in a 1:1 stoichiometry (PubMed:21288892). However, a recent study suggests a Zn(2+)-independent catalytic mechanism (By similarity)
B3GN2_HUMAN		Was indicated as B3Gal-T6 in submitted DNA entries
GOG6A_HUMAN		Maps to a duplicated region on chromosome 15; the gene is present in at least 4 almost identical copies
GTSE1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-20 is the initiator
MOCS1_HUMAN		The C-terminus of MOCS1A was previously believed to be thiocarboxylated, but it is now known not to be the case
ITSN2_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-2 is the initiator
ITSN2_HUMAN		Studies in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of ITGB1 and TFR used a siRNA mixture of ISTN1 and ISTN2 suggesting a partially overlapping role of the EH domain-containing proteins
AKIB1_HUMAN		Lacks one Cys residue in the IBR-type zinc finger domain that is one of the conserved features of the family
EP15R_HUMAN		Studies in clathrin-mediated endocytosis used a siRNA mixture of EPS15 and EPS15L1
S53A1_HUMAN		Confers susceptibility to xenotropic murine leukemia retrovirus (X-MLV) infection in vitro, but it is unclear whether its ability to act as a receptor for xenotropic and polytropic murine leukemia retroviruses is relevant in vivo and whether such viruses can infect human
DJB11_HUMAN		PubMed:11584023 reported a cytosolic, as well as nuclear subcellular location. This result was obtained using an N-terminally GFP-tagged construct which most probably affected signal peptide-driven targeting to the ER. As a consequence, the in vivo revelance of the observed interaction with APOBEC1, a nuclear protein, is dubious. This holds true for the interaction with PWP1
GTR6_HUMAN		Was initially thought to act as a glucose transporter (PubMed:10970791). However, later studies demonstrated that it does not transport glucose (PubMed:30431159)
GTR6_HUMAN		Was named GLUT9 by a report, but this gene name has already been used for SLC2A9
PCYOX_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a lyase and was therefore termed prenylcysteine lyase
CEIP2_HUMAN		A contradictory paper, using a cell-based assay with transfected 293T cell, reports that TMEM2 has no catalytic hyaluronic acid-degrading activity, although mouse TMEM2 exhibits hyaluronic acid-degrading activity in the same assay (PubMed:37196767). However, in Ref.12, authors claim a possible explanation for these contradictory results, they show that cell-based CEMIP2 hyaluronidase assays, as employed by Sato et al., can be confounded by the presence of unidentified factor(s) in cultures that suppress the hyaluronidase activity of CEMIP2 (PubMed:37527776)
NRBP_HUMAN		Author states that kinase activity observed in PubMed:11956649 may be due to sample contamination. This protein is predicted to be catalytically inactive
KIF25_HUMAN		In contrast to the ortholog protein in primates, human KIF25 protein is shorter at the N-terminus. While the kinesin motor domain is intact, it is unknown whether the absence of the N-terminus affects the microtubule-dependent motor activity
MCM8_HUMAN		Was initially thought to play a role in DNA replication (PubMed:15684404). However, it was later shown that it is mainly involved in homologous recombination repair (PubMed:23401855)
PARP4_HUMAN		Was initially thought to mediate to mediate poly-ADP-ribosylation of proteins (PubMed:10477748). However, it was later shown to act as a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase (PubMed:25043379)
MA1B1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-37 is the initiator
MYO15_HUMAN		Represents an unconventional myosin. This protein should not be confused with the conventional myosin-15 (MYH15)
ACINU_HUMAN		Structural and functional studies of the ASAP complex have been conducted with a chimeric complex involving a conserved fragment of Drosophila melanogaster Acinus/hkl
TM11E_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-2 is the initiator
ABCG2_HUMAN		Was originally proposed to function as a glutathione transporter (PubMed:20332504). However, some evidences suggest it is not the case (PubMed:24312054)
PLCL2_HUMAN		In the PI-PLC X-box Thr-486 is present instead of the conserved His which is one of the active site residues. It is therefore expected that this protein lacks catalytic activity
DICER_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-11 is the initiator
DICER_HUMAN		A paper describing truncating mutations of TARBP2 in tumor cells and resultant effects on DICER1 stability and miRNA processing has been retracted, due to concerns of image duplication in some of the figures
SPG7_HUMAN		A CDS in the 3'-UTR of SPG7 mRNA had been erroneously identified as a cell matrix adhesion regulator and originally thought to be encoded by the CMAR gene. There is no experimental evidence for the production of endogenous CMAR protein
SHLB1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-4 is the initiator
SHLB1_HUMAN		Was originally thought to have lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase activity, but by homology with SH3GL2/endophilin A1 is unlikely to have this activity
CIA30_HUMAN		There is a putative pseudogene of CIA30 on chromosome 19 (19p12)
DHRS7_HUMAN		DHRS7 was originally reported to be anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and facing the lumen (PubMed:24246760). However, the catalytic moiety was later shown to be facing the cytosol (PubMed:28457967)
LOXL2_HUMAN		The original paper reporting the role of LOXL2 in deamination of trimethylated 'Lys-4' of histone H3 was retracted due to inappropriate manipulation of figure data (PubMed:22483618, PubMed:27392148). However, this role was confirmed in a subsequent publication (PubMed:27735137)
ATG4B_HUMAN		A paper describing ATG4B tissue expression has been retracted, due to concerns of image duplication in some of the figures
INSI2_HUMAN		A study showed that INSIG2 is not ubiquitinated by AMFR/gp78 (PubMed:17043353). However, another paper showed that it is ubiquitinated on Cys-215, and that ubiquitination takes place in some tissues only and depends on the differentiation state (PubMed:31953408)
S22A7_HUMAN		Was shown to transport estrone-3-sulfate (E1S) (PubMed:28945155). However, E1S transport wasn't observed by other authors (PubMed:26500550). Although shown to transport alpha-ketoglutarate, it is unlikely that it is used as counteranion in exchange for isoform 2-mediated substrate uptake (PubMed:11327718, PubMed:26377792)
S22A7_HUMAN		Conflicting results have been published concerning SLC22A7/OAT2 isoform 1 function (PubMed:15901346). Was initially demonstrated to function as an organic anion (OA)/dicarboxylate antiporter where dicarboxylates such as fumarate or succinate act as counteranion in exchange for E1S uptake (PubMed:15901346). The same authors also showed that E1S, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), L-ascorbate and glutarate were transported by isoform 1 (PubMed:15901346). However, other authors demonstrated a complete loss of transport activity as a result of a lack of plasma membrane localization and inability to transport cGMP, E1S or DHEA-S (PubMed:18216183, PubMed:26500550)
PM2P1_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene
MYH7B_HUMAN		This protein sequence has been named 'Slow A' MYH14, but it also appears also as 'Slow B' MYH15 within the reference
MYH7B_HUMAN		Represents a conventional myosin. This protein should not be confused with the unconventional myosin-7 (MYO7)
MYO9A_HUMAN		Represents an unconventional myosin. This protein should not be confused with the conventional myosin-9 (MYH9)
BCL9_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-27 is the initiator
RCAS1_HUMAN		It was initially reported to be a ligand for some putative receptor present on T-, B-, natural killer (NK) cells and various human cell lines. However, PubMed:12672804 showed that it does not bind any receptor
PLPP1_HUMAN		Some reports could not detect a significant activity with sphingosine 1-phosphate as substrate
KMT2D_HUMAN		Another protein KMT2B/MLL4, located on chromosome 19, was first named MLL2 (see AC Q9UMN6). Thus, KMT2B/MLL4 is often referred to as MLL2 and vice versa in the literature
GEMI2_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-12 is the initiator
AURKA_HUMAN		Authors initially considered AURKA/STK6 and STK15 as 2 different proteins (PubMed:9771714). It is clear that they are the same protein
AURKA_HUMAN		An article that concluded that AURKA-mediated phosphorylation of BRCA1 'Ser-308' plays a role in the normal cell cycle G2/M transition was withdrawn due to data manipulation of flow cytometry data
ATS3_HUMAN		Has sometimes been referred to as ADAMTS4
S22A2_HUMAN		Most authors have deduced a localization at the basolateral membrane of proximal tubules (PubMed:11912245). Other studies demonstrated a localization to the luminal membrane in the distal tubule (PubMed:9260930)
OGT1_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be part of the MLL5-L complex, at least composed of KMT2E, STK38, PPP1CA, PPP1CB, PPP1CC, HCFC1, ACTB and OGT (PubMed:19377461). However, the corresponding article has been retracted (PubMed:24336203)
B4GA1_HUMAN		Was initially characterized as a beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase involved in the synthesis of poly-N-acetyllactosamine, able to initiate the synthesis or the elongation of the linear poly-N-acetyllactosaminoglycans (PubMed:9405606). However, it was later shown that it acts as a beta-1,4-glucuronyltransferase (PubMed:25279697, PubMed:25279699)
MYO1B_HUMAN		Represents an unconventional myosin. This protein should not be confused with the conventional myosin-1 (MYH1)
ATP9B_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-53 is the initiator
MFA3L_HUMAN		Protein kinase activity is reported (PubMed:24735981). However, no protein kinase domain is detected by any prediction method (PROSITE, Pfam). Its enzyme activity is therefore unsure
ATS4_HUMAN		Has sometimes been referred to as ADAMTS2
DEAF1_HUMAN		This protein was first known as suppressin (characterized in bovine neuroendocrine and immune cells). However, according to PubMed:9773984, it is uncertain whether it corresponds really to the suppressin also described in Ref.4. DEAF1 has been described as a nuclear dimeric protein and suppressin as a secreted monomeric protein
DPOLQ_HUMAN		A publication reported some endonuclease activity required to trim the 3' ends before synthesis can occur. However, subsequent research from the same group showed that DNA synthesis products generated by POLQ that migrate more quickly on denaturing polyacrylamide gels arise by production of stable stem-loop structures rather than from nuclease activity (PubMed:38640889). The original publication was therefore retracted
DPOLQ_HUMAN		Was wrongly named DNA polymerase eta (POLH) somne authors (Ref.4). This protein corresponds to DNA polymerase theta (POLQ) and should not be confused with DNA polymerase eta (POLH) (AC Q9Y253)
ECI2_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-3 is the initiator
KBL_HUMAN		One of the major routes for the degradation of L-threonine to glycine in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes takes place through a two-step biochemical pathway in mitochondria. In the first step, L-threonine is oxidized to (2S)-2-amino-3-oxobutanoate, by L-threonine 3-dehydrogenase tetramer (TDH). In the second step, mitochondrial 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate coenzyme A ligase (GCAT) catalyzes the reaction between (2S)-2-amino-3-oxobutanoate and coenzyme A to form glycine and acetyl-CoA. In human, however the enzyme thats catalyzes the fist reaction, TDH, is an expressed pseudogene encoding non-functional truncated proteins
RNF8_HUMAN		According to a well-established model, RNF8 initiate H2A 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination leading to recruitment of RNF168 to amplify H2A 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination (PubMed:19203578, PubMed:19203579). However, other data suggest that RNF168 is the priming ubiquitin ligase by mediating monoubiquitination of 'Lys-13' and 'Lys-15' of nucleosomal histone H2A (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub respectively) (PubMed:22980979). These data suggest that RNF168 might be recruited to DSBs sites in a RNF8-dependent manner by binding to non-histone proteins ubiquitinated via 'Lys-63'-linked and initiates monoubiquitination of H2A, which is then amplified by RNF8 (PubMed:22980979). Additional evidence is however required to confirm these data
SRBS2_HUMAN		Was shown to interact with AKT1 and PAK1 (PubMed:15784622). This work has later been retracted due to concerns of image manipulation
SO2B1_HUMAN		While some reports have shown that E1S transport exhibited single-saturation kinetics (PubMed:11932330, PubMed:14610227), other studies demonstrated a biphasic saturation kinetics (PubMed:11932330, PubMed:14610227, PubMed:22201122, Ref.25). Despite a previous report that demonstrated a pH-dependent substrate uptake and a transport stimulation at low pH (PubMed:14610227), another study did not observe any pH-dependent E1S and taurocholate transport (PubMed:14610227, PubMed:23531488). Was shown to mediate bile acid taurocholate transport at low pH in some studies (PubMed:14610227, PubMed:29871943), but not others (PubMed:11159893, PubMed:23531488, PubMed:29871943). The enterocyte localization of SLCO2B1/OATP2B1 remains uncertain. While some authors found it in the apical membrane (PubMed:12724351), consistent with a function as uptake carrier contributing to the intestinal absorption of drugs, other studies demonstrated a basolateral membrane expression, supporting a physiological role in substrate uptake from the blood flow and intestinal clearance (PubMed:12724351, PubMed:28408210)
ONEC2_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-20 is the initiator
HMHB1_HUMAN		This sequence containing mHag HB-1 may not represent the full-length protein, because functional domains are absent in this short gene product
HMHB1_HUMAN		PubMed:9892612 postulated that the initiator methionine is coded by a non-canonical CTG leucine codon
CYB_HUMAN		The full-length protein contains only eight transmembrane helices, not nine as predicted by bioinformatics tools
ANF_HUMAN		Results concerning the involvement of this peptide in blood volume and blood pressure homeostasis are conflicting. Several studies utilising in vitro and heterologous expression systems show that it is able to activate cGMP and promote vasodilation and natriuresis (PubMed:2825692, PubMed:7720651). However, an in vivo study in rat found that it is not sufficient to induce any diuretic, natriuretic, nor hypotensive responses, and is unable to bind NPR1 nor increase guanylyl cyclase activity (By similarity)
ANF_HUMAN		Results concerning the involvement of this peptide in blood volume and blood pressure homeostasis are conflicting. Several studies utilising in vitro and heterologous expression systems show that it is able to activate cGMP and promote vasodilation and natriuresis (PubMed:2825692, PubMed:7595132, PubMed:7720651). However, a heterologous expression study in rat found that it is not sufficient to induce any diuretic, natriuretic, nor hypotensive responses, and is unable to bind NPR1 nor increase guanylyl cyclase activity (PubMed:7831500)
LV140_HUMAN		For an example of a full-length immunoglobulin lambda light chain see AC P0DOX8
HV330_HUMAN		For examples of full-length immunoglobulin heavy chains (of different isotypes) see AC P0DOX2, AC P0DOX3, AC P0DOX4, AC P0DOX5 and AC P0DOX6
IGHG1_HUMAN		For an example of a full-length immunoglobulin gamma heavy chain see AC P0DOX5
IGHG4_HUMAN		For an example of a full-length immunoglobulin gamma heavy chain see AC P0DOX5
OPSG_HUMAN		Medium-wave-sensitive opsin genes vary in number among individuals and, together with a single red pigment gene, reside in a head-to-tail tandem array within the X chromosome. In the GRCh38 reference genome assembly, there are 3 genes in tandem coding for identical proteins AC P04001, AC P0DN77 and P0DN78
P53_HUMAN		Interaction with BANP was reported to enhance phosphorylation on Ser-15 upon ultraviolet irradiation (PubMed:15701641). However, the publication has been retracted due to image duplication and manipulation. Interaction with BANP has been confirmed in mouse studies (By similarity). Phosphorylation at Ser-15 has been confirmed by other studies (PubMed:10570149, PubMed:11554766, PubMed:15866171, PubMed:16219768, PubMed:17317671, PubMed:17954561, PubMed:20959462, PubMed:25772236). Its nuclear and cytoplasmic localization has been confirmed by other studies (PubMed:15340061, PubMed:17170702, PubMed:17591690, PubMed:18206965, PubMed:19011621, PubMed:21597459, PubMed:22726440)
TPM3_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-2 is the initiator
TRY1_HUMAN		Tyr-154 was proposed to be phosphorylated (PubMed:8683601) but it has been shown (PubMed:17087724) to be sulfated instead. Phosphate and sulfate groups are similar in mass and size, and this can lead to erroneous interpretation of the results
SYEP_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase
RET_HUMAN		Original thought to be dephosphorylated by PTPRJ on Tyr-905, Tyr-1015 and Tyr-1062. However this paper was retracted due to manipulation of immunoblot data
MSMB_HUMAN		Was originally thought to inhibit the secretion of FSH by pituitary cells
H2AB1_HUMAN		Although related to histone H2AB1 in mouse (AC Q9CQ70), it is unclear whether human and mouse H2AB1 proteins are involved in similar processes. In mouse, histone H2AB1 is specifically required to direct the transformation of dissociating nucleosomes to protamine in male germ cells during spermatogenesis. It is however unclear whether human protein, which participates in mRNA processing and is associated with active transcription, is also involved in nucleosomes to protamine replacement (PubMed:22795134)
PA24B_HUMAN		Most tissues also express read-through transcripts from this gene into the upstream gene (JMJD7), some of which may encode fusion proteins
CFC1_HUMAN		This gene differs from CFC1B by only one residue at position 78:R -> W. R78W is also thought to be a CFC1 polymorphism which has been shown to lead to a different cell surface distribution and activity (PubMed:11062482, PubMed:11799476)
ST1A3_HUMAN		Found in a segmental duplication on p arm of chromosome 16 giving rise to two identical copies of this gene sharing exons with SLX1A and SLX1B. The ORFs of SULT1A3 and SULT1A4 differ with only a single nucleotide change that does not alter the encoded amino acid. It is not possible to determine whether any individual polymorphism is present within SULT1A3 or SULT1A4 (PubMed:15358107)
AMY1B_HUMAN		Three distinct genes (AMY1A, AMY1B and AMY1C), located in a gene cluster on 1p21, encode proteins sharing the same peptidic sequence
TRBR2_HUMAN		This sequence is an example of a full-length TR beta chain. Pan-cancer TRBV25-1*01J2S3*01C2*01 TCR beta chain is generated by somatic recombination of variable TRBV25-1 (AC A0A075B6N4) and joining TRBJ2-3 (AC A0A0B4J200) gene segments spliced to constant TRBC2*01 (AC A0A5B9) gene segment
BIP_HUMAN		AMPylation was initially reported to take place at Ser-365 and Thr-366 in vitro, and promote activation of HSPA5/BiP (PubMed:25601083). However, it was later shown that AMPylation takes place at Thr-518 and leads to inactivation of HSPA5/BiP
VDR_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-4 is the initiator
VDR_HUMAN		Was thought to be recruited to promoters via its interaction with BAZ1B/WSTF, but this work has later been retracted
MYH1_HUMAN		Represents a conventional myosin. This protein should not be confused with the unconventional myosin-1 (MYO1)
MYH7_HUMAN		Represents a conventional myosin. This protein should not be confused with the unconventional myosin-7 (MYO7)
CCL4_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a ligand for CCR8
MYH6_HUMAN		Represents a conventional myosin. This protein should not be confused with the unconventional myosin-6 (MYO6)
PDIA4_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a deoxycytidine kinase
DRB4_HUMAN		HLA-DRB3, HLA-DRB4 and HLA-DRB5 may represent a unique gene
T2FB_HUMAN		GTF2F2 appears to have ATP-dependent DNA-helicase activity; however this is probably an artifact that happened during the protein purification
ATF2_HUMAN		Appears to have histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, specifically towards histones H2B and H4 in vitro (PubMed:10821277). However, it is not clear if this activity is genuine or caused by contamination with other histone acetyltransferases in the assay
NCPR_HUMAN		An alternative upstream Met is found in primates and translation may initiate from the upstream Met which would give rise to a 680-residue protein. However, the upstream codon has a weak Kozak signal while the codon used for translation of the shorter 677-residue sequence has a strong Kozak signal and is widely conserved. In addition, protein sequencing indicates that this is the preferred start codon in vivo
CXA1_HUMAN		PubMed:7715640 reported a mutation Pro-364 linked to congenital heart diseases. PubMed:8873667 later shown that it is an artifact
CXA1_HUMAN		PubMed:11741837 reported 2 mutations (Phe-11 and Ala-24) linked to non-syndromic autosomal recessive deafness (DFNBG). These mutations have subsequently been shown (PubMed:12457340) to involve the pseudogene of connexin-43 located on chromosome 5
DDX5_HUMAN		DDX5 was reported to be a transcriptional coactivator of ESR1. However, this study has been retracted due to concerns of image manipulation
BCL3_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-9 is the initiator
THTM_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be rhodanese
DCK_HUMAN		Was shown to be phosphorylated and activated by CSNK1D/CK1 in vitro but probably not in vivo
PRDX3_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether transit peptide cleavage occurs after His-61 or Ala-62. Peptides have been found for both N-termini
PDIA3_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate phosphodiesterase type I (phospholipase C-alpha)
AKT1_HUMAN		PUBMED:20231902 has been retracted because there was evidence of data fabrication and/or falsification in multiple figure panels
AKT1_HUMAN		PUBMED:19940129 has been retracted because the same data were used to represent different experimental conditions
AKT1_HUMAN		In light of strong homologies in the primary amino acid sequence, the 3 AKT kinases were long surmised to play redundant and overlapping roles. More recent studies has brought into question the redundancy within AKT kinase isoforms and instead pointed to isoform specific functions in different cellular events and diseases. AKT1 is more specifically involved in cellular survival pathways, by inhibiting apoptotic processes; whereas AKT2 is more specific for the insulin receptor signaling pathway. Moreover, while AKT1 and AKT2 are often implicated in many aspects of cellular transformation, the 2 isoforms act in a complementary opposing manner. The role of AKT3 is less clear, though it appears to be predominantly expressed in brain
PE2R4_HUMAN		Was originally designated as the EP2 subtype
HXD13_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-9 is the initiator
8ODP_HUMAN		The role in cancer cell survival is under debate. Was originally considered to play a role as a sanitizing enzyme for oxidized nucleotide pools, and thus important for the survival of cancer cells (PubMed:24695224, PubMed:24695225). A later study indicates that NUDT1 plays a redundant role in eliminating oxidized nucleotides and that it is not essential for cancer cell proliferation and survival (PubMed:28679043)
PP1G_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be part of the MLL5-L complex, at least composed of KMT2E, STK38, PPP1CA, PPP1CB, PPP1CC, HCFC1, ACTB and OGT (PubMed:19377461). However, the corresponding article has been retracted (PubMed:24336203)
COFA1_HUMAN		The name restin has also been used for CAP-Gly domain-containing linker protein 1 the product of the CLIP1 gene
CEAM3_HUMAN		This is not the ortholog of rat CEACAM3
PSMD8_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-64 is the initiator
RBP2_HUMAN		Despite the presence of a PPIase cyclophilin-type domain, it has probably no peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity
CAMP_HUMAN		PubMed:11238224 sequence was incorrectly assigned to originate from M.mulatta
AGTR2_HUMAN		AGTR2 has been reported to be involved in X-linked intellectual disability (PubMed:12089445). Its pathological role is however questionable (PubMed:23871722)
GALC_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-17 is the initiator
SEC13_HUMAN		The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of the GATOR2 complex is subject to discussion (PubMed:35831510, PubMed:36528027). According to a report, the GATOR2 complex does not catalyze ubiquitination of the GATOR1 complex (PubMed:35831510). In contrast, another publication showed that the GATOR2 complex mediates ubiquitination of the NPRL2 core component of the GATOR1 complex, leading to GATOR1 inactivation (PubMed:36528027)
PSA_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-45 is the initiator. N-terminal sequencing in PubMed:10978616 suggests that Met-45 is used, followed by methionine initiator removal
UCP2_HUMAN		The role of UCP2/SLC25A8 in mitochondrial proton conductance is a matter of debate. It was initially suggested that it mediates proton leak that increases net proton conductance in response to ROS such as reactive alkenals generated during fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria. By lowering the proton motive force, it would provide for feedback control of mitochondrial ROS metabolism limiting extensive ROS production and protecting cells against oxidative stress. This activity and its potential regulation by ubiquinones and nucleotides was disputed by later studies, which failed to reproduce the effect on proton conductance under physiological conditions. Rather than 'uncoupling' the link between electron transfer and ATP synthesis, it may couple metabolite transport to proton flux to allow for optimal ATP turnover
SYCY2_HUMAN		CKS-17 sequence does not match the minimal active consensus
ACTB_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be part of the MLL5-L complex, at least composed of KMT2E, STK38, PPP1CA, PPP1CB, PPP1CC, HCFC1, ACTB and OGT (PubMed:19377461). However, the corresponding article has been retracted (PubMed:24336203)
TGFB2_HUMAN		In contrast to other members of the family, does not contain a R-G-D cell attachment site motif that mediates binding to integrins and promotes release of Latency-associated peptide (LAP) chain from TGF-beta-2
PP1A_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be part of the MLL5-L complex, at least composed of KMT2E, STK38, PPP1CA, PPP1CB, PPP1CC, HCFC1, ACTB and OGT (PubMed:19377461). However, the corresponding article has been retracted (PubMed:24336203)
PP1B_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be part of the MLL5-L complex, at least composed of KMT2E, STK38, PPP1CA, PPP1CB, PPP1CC, HCFC1, ACTB and OGT (PubMed:19377461). However, the corresponding article has been retracted (PubMed:24336203)
GRB2_HUMAN		Was shown to interact with ZDHHC19, leading to recruitment of STAT3. However, this study was later retracted
FABP5_HUMAN		While mouse FABP5 is found only in the monomeric form, human FABP5 can exist as a monomer as well as a domain-swapped dimer
DEF5_HUMAN		It was shown by two studies that dimerization of DEFA5 is crucial for antimicrobial activity (PubMed:17088326, PubMed:22573326). Another study, however, states that dimer formation is not indispensable for antimicrobial activity of DEFA5 (PubMed:25782105)
OTUD4_HUMAN		When expressed in bacteria, recombinant OTUD4 specifically hydrolyzes 'Lys-48'-linked diubiquitin. The physiological relevance of this activity remains unknown (PubMed:23827681, PubMed:25944111, PubMed:29395066). In vivo deubiquitinates 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitin chains (PubMed:29395066)
LEG10_HUMAN		Was originally thought to possess lysophospholipase activity but the absence of this activity has been shown by PubMed:11834744
KPCZ_HUMAN		Reported to phosphorylate STK11 leading to nuclear export of STK11, subsequent inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling, and increased apoptosis in vein endothelial cells treated with the oxidant peroxynitrite (PubMed:18321849). However this paper was withdrawn by the authors due to concerns of image duplication in the figures. Its role in protein phosphorylation has been confirmed in other studies (PubMed:15084291, PubMed:15324659)
EXOS9_HUMAN		The six exosome core subunits containing a RNase PH-domain are not phosphorolytically active
SUH_HUMAN		Despite some similarity with the 'phage' integrase family, it has no recombinase activity
P5F1B_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene. Several pseudogenes of POU5F1 have been described on chromosomes 1, 3, 8, 10 and 12. Two of them, localized on chromosomes 8 and 10 have been shown to be preferentially transcribed in cancer tissues and may be involved in the regulation of POU5F1 gene activity in carcinogenesis
GOG8D_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene. A family of highly similar proteins (GOLGA8A, GOLGA8B, GOLGA8C, GOLGA8D, GOLGA8E, GOLGA8F, GOLGA8G) are encoded by a repeated region on chromosome 15q11-15q13. Our sequences are in agreement with HGNC nomenclature
TMM94_HUMAN		Although it has been proposed to function as a new cation transport ATPase (P-type) and serve as an endoplasmic reticulum magnesium-transporting P-type ATPase, these claims are debated and require further confirmation
NPRL3_HUMAN		Ser-489 is missing in the human genome assembly but is present in all available mRNAs and ESTs
STRN3_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be nuclear
TRAF1_HUMAN		Lacks a RING domain and has therefore no E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity by itself
CLN3_HUMAN		Mao et al suggest that CLN3 has five transmembranes with a long lumenal N-terminus because their antibody does not immunoprecipitate the N-terminus in the presence of microsomes
MYO7A_HUMAN		Represents an unconventional myosin. This protein should not be confused with the conventional myosin-7 (MYH7)
MYO7A_HUMAN		Originally predicted to contain a coiled coil domain but proposed to contain a stable SAH domain instead
MTMR3_HUMAN		A weak protein phosphatase activity was also detected in vitro and MTMR3 considered a dual specificity protein phosphatase (PubMed:10733931). However, experimental evidences suggest MTMR3 is a specific phosphoinositide 3-phosphatases (PubMed:11302699, PubMed:11676921, PubMed:12646134)
CAPR1_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a GPI-anchored membrane protein
HLTF_HUMAN		In contrast with other SMARC proteins, there is currently no evidence that it associates with actin or actin-related proteins. It may rather act as a sequence-specific DNA binding ATPase, whose precise function remains to be fully characterized
ABRX2_HUMAN		Although strongly related to the ABRAXAS1 protein, lacks the C-terminal pSXXF that constitutes a specific recognition motif for the BRCT domain of BRCA1
NOMO1_HUMAN		There are 3 copies of the NOMO gene on chromosome 16p12-p13: NOMO1, NOMO2 (AC Q5JPE7) and NOMO3 (AC P69849). All 3 are extremely similar, which makes their individual characterization difficult. Thus, most experiments probably do not discriminate between the different members. Moreover, it does not allow a clear view of which variant belongs to which of the 3 copies. The results reported in other entries may therefore apply for this protein
RGN_HUMAN		Gluconolactonase catalyzes a key step in ascorbic acid (vitamin C) biosynthesis, but primates lack the last enzyme in the pathway and are unable to synthesize vitamin C
CH3L2_HUMAN		Lacks the conserved sequence motif DxxDxDxE that is essential for the catalytic activity of chitinases of the glycosyl hydrolase 18 family, and therefore has no chitinase activity
EZH2_HUMAN		Two variants of the PRC2 complex have been described, termed PRC3 and PRC4. Each of the three complexes may include a different complement of EED isoforms, although the precise sequences of the isoforms in each complex have not been determined. The PRC2 and PRC4 complexes may also methylate 'Lys-26' of histone H1 in addition to 'Lys-27' of histone H3 (PubMed:15099518, PubMed:15684044). In contrast, other studies have demonstrated no methylation of 'Lys-26' of histone H1 by PRC2 (PubMed:16431907)
DPYL2_HUMAN		Lacks most of the conserved residues that are essential for binding the metal cofactor and hence for dihydropyrimidinase activity. Its enzyme activity is therefore unsure
MOG_HUMAN		Do not confuse myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) with oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein (OMG)
QPCT_HUMAN		It is unclear whether this protein requires a metal cofactor for catalysis. It was originally proposed to be a Zn(2+)-dependent metalloenzyme based on structural similarities to bacterial aminopeptidases and the observation that it can bind Zn(2+) ions, typically in a 1:1 stoichiometry (PubMed:18072935, PubMed:21288892). However, a recent study suggests a Zn(2+)-independent catalytic mechanism (By similarity)
GLO2_HUMAN		Only one single gene encoding glyoxalase II has been identified in vertebrates. In yeast and higher plants, separate genes encode the cytosolic and mitochondrial forms of glyoxalase II
ZN827_HUMAN		The function in telomere maintenance is inferred from experiments in cells displaying alternative lengthening of telomeres/ALT a process specific of cancer cells
HSDL1_HUMAN		Although it belongs to the SDR family, Phe-218 is present instead of the conserved Tyr which is an active site residue. It is therefore expected that this protein lacks oxidoreductase activity
FNDC1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-53 is the initiator
PKHG4_HUMAN		Defects in PLEKHG4 were initially thought (PubMed:16001362) to be the cause of spinocerebellar ataxia 16q22-linked. However, it was later shown (PubMed:17611710) that it is not the case. Spinocerebellar ataxia 16q22-linked, also known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 31 (SCA31), is caused by defects in BEAN gene
ZC12A_HUMAN		Was originally proposed to bind to DNA and act as transcription factor
ESCO1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-2 is the initiator
SH319_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-4 is the initiator
CXG2_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-4 is the initiator
MT21C_HUMAN		Contradictory results have been reported with regards to its ability to methylate HSPA8 and VCP. One study found that METTL21C methylated HSPA8, whereas one other reported methylation of VCP, but the experimental evidence was in both cases rather limited (By similarity). Indeed, a subsequent, third study fails to observe in vitro activity of METTL21C on either HSPA8 or VCP (PubMed:32611769)
PAPD7_HUMAN		Was originally thought to have DNA polymerase activity
CAR17_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene
KCD11_HUMAN		A N-terminal fragment of KCTD11 isoform 2 (comprising residues 15 - 115) has been used for some KCTD11:CUL3 interaction studies
KDM4D_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-4 is the initiator
H2B2D_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene. In contrast to other H2B histones, it does not contain the conserved residue in C-terminus that is the target of monoubiquitination
JMJD6_HUMAN		Was initially thought to constitute the phosphatidylserine receptor, a receptor that mediates recognition of phosphatidylserine, a specific marker only present at the surface of apoptotic cells. Phosphatidylserine receptor probably participates in apoptotic cell phagocytosis. This protein was identified using phage display expressing mAb 217, an antibody that specifically recognizes phosphatidylserine receptor. However, its nuclear localization and the fact that mAb 217 antibody still recognizes the phosphatidylserine receptor in mice lacking JMJD6, strongly suggest that it does not constitute the receptor for phosphatidylserine and is not involved in apoptotic cell removal
FXL19_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-21 is the initiator
GASP3_HUMAN		Despite its name, no basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain is detected by any prediction tool
U17L6_HUMAN		The RS447 megasatellite DNA is a highly polymorphic conserved tandem repetitive sequence which contains a copy of the USP17 gene. It is present with an interindividual variation in copy number, ranging from 20 to 103, and can be found in the genome both on chromosome 4 and chromosome 8. The high similarity between the UPS17-like genes makes impossible to clearly assign data to one of the genes of the family. Oligonucleotides designed in RNAi experiments are for instance not specific of a given UPS17-like gene
CWC27_HUMAN		Despite the fact that it belongs to the cyclophilin-type PPIase family, a report has shown that it has probably no peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity
CERS6_HUMAN		Some prediction bioinformatics tools predict the presence of a homeobox domain (By similarity). However, the domain is degenerate and residues that are important for DNA-binding are absent (By similarity). Moreover, the protein localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum and not in the nucleus, strongly suggesting that it does not constitute a canonical homeobox domain (By similarity)
S39A5_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-2 is the initiator
ATL5_HUMAN		Although strongly similar to members of the ADAMTS family it lacks the metalloprotease and disintegrin-like domains which are typical of that family
DYH12_HUMAN		Was originally derived from a readthrough transcript including ASB14 and DNAH12. DNHD2 was thought to be a distinct gene
TTL10_HUMAN		Two inactivating mutations in human TTLL10 (Ser-448 and Lys-467) are proposed to explain the lack of polyglycylation
CSN6_HUMAN		Although related to the peptidase M67A family, it lacks the JAMM motif that probably constitutes the catalytic center and therefore it probably does not have a protease activity
ENOF1_HUMAN		Was originally (PubMed:8493092) identified as a gene coding for an antisense RNA to thymidylate synthase, and was proposed to down-regulate TYMS activity (PubMed:8869746), possibly by promoting the degradation of TYMS mRNA via an antisense RNA-based mechanism (PubMed:12084460)
PEG10_HUMAN		Was reported to be activated by androgen receptor agonist dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in hepatic cancer cells (HCC), resulting in HCC growth and apoptotic resistance. However, this study was later retracted
LYRIC_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a type II membrane protein but this is inconsistent with the results of multiple phosphorylation studies because this topology would locate the phosphorylation sites in the lumen or extracellularly rather than in the cytoplasm
CASZ1_HUMAN		According to PubMed:16322216, another protein (SRG) is encoded on the 3'-UTR of the CASZ1 gene. The existence of this protein that may play a role in apoptosis is extremely dubious despite the fact it was localized in the cytoplasm with the help of a polyclonal antibody
PIGZ_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-32 is the initiator
RASF3_HUMAN		Was termed (Ref.1) RASSF5
FBX11_HUMAN		Has been initially named PRMT9 and reported to act as an arginine methyltransferase that can catalyze the formation of omega-N monomethylarginine (MMA) as well as symmetrical and asymmetrical dimethylarginine (sDMA and aDMA), however no further works support these observations (PubMed:16487488). It should not be confused with official PRMT9 (AC Q6P2P2)
ZDH17_HUMAN		Thought to palmitoylate MPP1 (PubMed:22496366). This work was later retracted due to image manipulation
TEX14_HUMAN		Ser-376 is present instead of the conserved Asp which is expected to be an active site residue
DI3L2_HUMAN		Although assigned as two separate genes (DIS3L2 and FAM6A), it is quite clear that the gene FAM6A described by PubMed:11352565 is a fragmentary prediction of DIS3L2
GT252_HUMAN		Has no glucosyltransferase activity
RN168_HUMAN		According to a well-established model, RNF168 cannot initiate H2A 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination and is recruited following RNF8-dependent histone ubiquitination to amplify H2A 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination (PubMed:19203578, PubMed:19203579, PubMed:19500350). However, other data suggest that RNF168 is the priming ubiquitin ligase by mediating monoubiquitination of 'Lys-13' and 'Lys-15' of nucleosomal histone H2A (H2AK13Ub and H2AK15Ub respectively) (PubMed:22980979). These data suggest that RNF168 might be recruited to DSBs sites in a RNF8-dependent manner by binding to non-histone proteins ubiquitinated via 'Lys-63'-linked and initiates monoubiquitination of H2A, which is then amplified by RNF8 (PubMed:22980979). Additional evidence is however required to confirm these data
KMT2E_HUMAN		Isoform 3 was originally thought to display histone methyltransferase activity only following O-glycosylation at Thr-440 (PubMed:19377461). However, the corresponding article has been retracted (PubMed:24336203). Does not exhibit histone methyltransferase towards histone H3 in vitro (PubMed:19264965, PubMed:27812132). The isolated catalytic SET domain lacks binding activity towards cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine; instead of the highly conserved XGXG, Y and NH motifs, KMT2E displays NKKI (Asn-339-Ile-342), F (Phe-381) and RR (Arg-408-Arg-409) motifs (PubMed:27812132). Also lacks binding activity towards histone H3 due to a poor conservation of the key residues involved in the binding and the presence of large loop which prevents the docking of the H3 'Lys-4' side chain (PubMed:27812132)
KT222_HUMAN		According to PubMed:16831889, it is a pseudogene
PLD6_HUMAN		Evidence for subcellular location in the Golgi was determined in pachytene spermatocytes and spermatids in mouse testes. They observe that the ectopically expressed PLD6 protein was localized to the mitochondria in PLD6-transfected cells. Authors claim a possible explanation for the contradictory results is that previous studies have reported the localization of exogenous PLD6, but not endogenous PLD6, in cultured cells. The reason for differences observed in subcellular localization of exogenous and endogenous PLD6 is not clear but one attributable reason may be that different types of anti-PLD6 antibodies have been used in previous studies
ABD12_HUMAN		A family suffering from Polyneuropathy, hearing loss, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, and cataract (PHARC) was initially clinically diagnosed with Usher syndrome type 3 (PubMed:22938382). Reexamination of one affected member of this family revealed ataxia but not polyneuropathy, demonstrating the phenotypic heterogeneity in PHARC and the need for careful neurological assessments to distinguish this disease from other neuropathic disorders (PubMed:22938382)
KDM8_HUMAN		The demethylase activity of JMJD5 is controversial. Demethylase activity toward H3K36me2 was observed in vivo and in vitro (PubMed:20457893). In addition, demethylase activity toward H3K36me3 when in a complex with RCCD1 has been observed (PubMed:24981860). In contrast, in other studies, JMJD5 was shown not to display any demethylase activity toward methylated H3K36 nor toward other methyllysines in the N-terminal tails of H3 and H4 in vitro (PubMed:22851697, PubMed:24100311, PubMed:28982940)
ZCHC7_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-2 is the initiator
GBGT1_HUMAN		The Forssman antigen (FORS1) is normally expressed on erythrocytes of some non-primate mammals. However, in rare cases it is expressed on human erythrocytes of histo-blood group FORS carriers
CISD2_HUMAN		Although initially thought (PubMed:17846994) to be a zinc-finger protein, it was later shown (PubMed:17376863) that it binds 1 2Fe-2S cluster instead
JAGN1_HUMAN		Experiments in mouse confirm the importance of JAGN1 in neutrophil function with some differences. Mice lacking JAGN1 do not show neutropenia and display increased susceptibility to fungal infections due to defective killing capacity of neutrophil granulocytes
ATL1_HUMAN		Although strongly similar to members of the ADAMTS family it lacks the metalloprotease and disintegrin-like domains which are typical of that family
OTU6B_HUMAN		Initially, no deubiquitinase activity could be detected when tested (PubMed:23827681). Other studies, show an obvious deubiquitinase activity (PubMed:21267069, PubMed:27864334, PubMed:28343629)
AMPO_HUMAN		A paper describing the function, enzyme activity and expression patterns of this protein has been retracted due to concerns of image manipulation
SIR6_HUMAN		Upon DNA damage, was reported to promote DNA end resection via deacetylation of RBBP8. However, this study was later retracted
SIR6_HUMAN		The binding-mode of MDL-801 selective activator is subject to discussion (PubMed:30374165, PubMed:33649599, PubMed:33649600). According to a group, MDL-801 binds around the acyl channel exit and acts as an allosteric activator (PubMed:30374165, PubMed:33649600). According to another group, the binding mode of MDL-801 remains undefined (PubMed:33649599)
ARF_HUMAN		The proteins described here are encoded by the gene CDKN2A, but are completely unrelated in terms of sequence and function to cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (AC P42771) which is encoded by the same gene
NHLC2_HUMAN		Contains a thioredoxin domain, but lacks thioredoxin activity
GOLM1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-2 is the initiator
GT251_HUMAN		Has no glucosyltransferase activity
CA131_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-11 is the initiator
NCKX4_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-18 is the initiator
ARK74_HUMAN		It has been speculated that AKR7L encodes a selenoprotein, which includes a selenocysteine (Sec) residue in lieu of a UGA translational termination codon at position 106 (PubMed:12879023). However, there is no evidence that such a protein is produced in vivo
ARK74_HUMAN		The sequence shown in this entry differs from the translation of the reference genome assembly (GRCh38/hg38) due to a nonsense variant creating stop codon at position 106 in the reference genome
NEIL3_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be inactive as a glycosylase (PMID:12200441,PMID:19121397), but recent reports (PMID:22569481, PMID:20185759) demonstrate that cleavage of the initiator methionine is essential for catalytic activity
S7A14_HUMAN		Initially postulated to transport L-arginine based on studies with a chimeric protein, which was not confirmed by other groups using the wild-type protein. It was latter shown to rather function as a GABA importer
RAE1E_HUMAN		Contrary to other family members, does not interact with CMV glycoprotein UL16
MICA1_HUMAN		The reaction mechanism is subject to discussion. Some work suggest MICAL enzymes directly oxidize actin methionine residues to produce methionine-(R)-S-oxide. Other publications suggest that the enzyme functions as a NADPH oxidase producing H(2)O(2) (EC 1.6.3.1) and that it is the produced H(2)O(2) that is responsible for the methionine-(R)-S-oxide production
SHRM3_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-2 is the initiator. Met-2 is more conserved than Met-1 among the orthologs
TGFA1_HUMAN		In (PubMed:9545258) and in (PubMed:10051563) experimental information is given for a truncated version of TGFBRAP1 (sequence of 474-860), which was later shown to act as a dominant negative
OSCP1_HUMAN		The polymorphism 'Glu58Gly' (described in PubMed:12819961) is in fact an error, the G to A change described representing a synonymous mutation that does not induce any amino acid change in Gly-32
RASF5_HUMAN		Was termed (Ref.3) RASSF3
CCL17_HUMAN		Although CCL17 was shown to bind to CCR8, additional studies demonstrated that CCR4, not CCR8, was the bona fide CCL17 receptor
CCL17_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a ligand for CCR8
ESR2_HUMAN		Had previously been shown to interact with PELP1. However this paper was retracted as cell-based data was viewed as unreliable
PTPR2_HUMAN		Has no tyrosine-protein phosphatase activity at mild acidic conditions (pH 5.5). The in vivo relevance of the low PPase activity at acidic conditions (pH 4.5) is questioned. This catalytic activity seems to be affected by the replacement of a highly conserved residue in the tyrosine-protein phosphatase domain
BAD_HUMAN		The protein name 'Bcl2 antagonist of cell death' may be misleading. The protein antagonises Bcl2-mediated repression of cell death, hence it promotes apoptosis
HMR1_HUMAN		Reported to be associated with components of the peptide-loading complex, TAPBP, CALR, CANX and PDIA3 (PubMed:12794138, PubMed:23457030). This association in primary cells and its functional relevance is disputable, given that antigen presentation and MAIT cell activation is shown to be TAP1-TAP2 and proteasome-independent
S35B4_HUMAN		It was initially reported to localize to the Golgi apparatus, but this was later found to be artifactual mislocalization due to C-terminal tagging interfering with the ER retention signal
TET5B_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-2 is the initiator
S22AI_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-17 is the initiator
TLCD1_HUMAN		Was originally proposed to be a calcium channel facilitator (By similarity). However, a more recent study shows that this protein regulates membrane phospholipid homeostasis (PubMed:30509349). Therefore, any effects on calcium flux are most likely a secondary consequence of defects in membrane composition or fluidity (PubMed:30509349)
CERS2_HUMAN		Contains a predicted homeobox domain which is degenerated and lacks residues that are important for DNA-binding. The protein localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum and not in the nucleus, which also argues against homeobox function (PubMed:18165233)
CERS2_HUMAN		Some prediction bioinformatics tools predict the presence of a homeobox domain (By similarity). However, the domain is degenerate and residues that are important for DNA-binding are absent (By similarity). Moreover, the protein localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum and not in the nucleus, strongly suggesting that it does not constitute a canonical homeobox domain (PubMed:18165233)
KLD7B_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-100 is the initiator
WNK4_HUMAN		Was named WNK/'with no lysine(K)' because key residues for catalysis, including the lysine involved in ATP binding, are either not conserved or differ compared to the residues described in other kinase family proteins
MY15B_HUMAN		Represents an unconventional myosin. This protein should not be confused with the conventional myosin-15 (MYH15)
CEP19_HUMAN		The region that interacts with CEP43 is conflicting: According to a report, interacts via N-terminus (PubMed:28428259). According to another report, interacts via C-terminus (PubMed:28659385)
FA20A_HUMAN		Although strongly related to other members of the family, lacks the kinase activity. A conserved Asp/Glu residue present in other members of the family, which coordinates the Mn(2+) ion and the ion-pair Lys and is indispensable for kinase activity, is replaced by a Gln in position 258
CTSR2_HUMAN		In mouse, Slco6c1 is an additional auxiliary subunit of the CatSper complex. It is unclear if the related SLCO6A1 protein performs the same role in non-rodent species
AGRA2_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-8 is the initiator
SORC2_HUMAN		The N-terminus of the protein was constructed in analogy to that of the mouse ortholog using the sequence of chromosome 4
AQP10_HUMAN		Initial experiments showed that it is permeable to water but not to glycerol. However, this could be due to the pH conditions under which it was assessed rather than isoform specificity (PubMed:11573934)
MTMR9_HUMAN		Although it belongs to the non-receptor class myotubularin subfamily, lacks the conserved active site cysteine residue at position 333 in the dsPTPase catalytic loop, suggesting that it has no phosphatase activity
WDR24_HUMAN		The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of the GATOR2 complex is subject to discussion (PubMed:35831510, PubMed:36528027). According to a report, the GATOR2 complex does not catalyze ubiquitination of the GATOR1 complex (PubMed:35831510). In contrast, two studies from a same group show that the WDR24 component of the GATOR2 complex mediates ubiquitination of the NPRL2 core component of the GATOR1 complex, leading to GATOR1 inactivation (PubMed:36528027, PubMed:36732624)
RANB9_HUMAN		According to some authors RANBP9 is located in centrosomes and involved in microtubule assembly. Other authors infirmed these results
CK5P1_HUMAN		CDK5RAP1 was proposed to act on both nuclear and mitochondrial RNA (PubMed:22422838). However, another study shows that ms2i6A is a mitochondrial tRNA specific modification and is absent from nuclear encoded RNA species, implying that there is no methylthiotransferase activity on nuclear RNA (PubMed:28981754)
S38A3_HUMAN		PMID:10823827 shows that the transport process is electrogenic with a Na(+):L-glutamine stoichiometry of 2:1, contrary to the conclusions of Chaudhry et al (PMID:10619430) who finds that the transport is electroneutral with a Na(+):L-glutamine stoichiometry of 1:1. Chaudhry et al (PMID:11742981) shows that this electrogenic transport describes by Fei et al (PMID:10823827) would correspond to an amino acid-gated H(+) conductance that is not stoichiometrically coupled to the amino acid transport but which influences the ionic gradients that drive the amino acid transport (By similarity)
PI51A_HUMAN		There is confusion in the literature with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase type I nomenclature due to the fact that frequently mouse PIP5K1B is named Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase type I alpha
MICU1_HUMAN		The topology was subject to discussion (PubMed:23747253, PubMed:26387864, PubMed:26489515). According to a publication, forms an intramembrane hairpin loop without crossing the membrane (PubMed:23747253). Other studies suggested that it contains a transmembrane region that crosses the mitochondrial inner membrane, with the main part of the protein localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (PubMed:26387864, PubMed:26489515). 3D structures of the uniplex complex however showed that MICU1 does not contain any transmembrane or intramembrane hairpin loop and localizes at the outer surface of the mitochondrion inner membrane in the intermembrane space (PubMed:32494073, PubMed:32667285, PubMed:32862359)
MICU1_HUMAN		According to a report, MICU1 does not occlude MCU at low calcium levels and instead acts by potentiating the activity of MCU (PubMed:34463251). However, other reports confirmed the ability of MICU2 to occlude the MCU pore at low calcium levels (PubMed:37036971, PubMed:37126688)
TTYH2_HUMAN		According to PubMed:34385445, lacks Ca(2+)-activated chloride channel and swelling-dependent volume-regulated anion channel activities
HTAI2_HUMAN		Was originally (PubMed:9482853, PubMed:10698937) thought to be a transcriptional coregulator with protein kinase activity. However, crystal structure reveals a short chain dehydrogenase/reductase fold binding NADPH rather than ATP
SNR25_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-10 is the initiator
REPI1_HUMAN		Was believed to function in chromosomal DNA replication initiation, later studies however do not corroborate this theory
TM2D1_HUMAN		Was originally (PubMed:11278849) thought to modulate amyloid-beta toxicity by coupling to G protein. However, PubMed:12836168 showed that this effect is not direct
TRPM6_HUMAN		Whether TRPM6 forms functional homomeric channels by itself is still under debate. According to PubMed:14576148 and PubMed:16636202, TRPM6 are able to form TRPM6 channels with similar properties to those of TRPM7, with biophysical characteristics resembling those of TRPM7 including the high channel pore selectivity for divalent cations and regulation by intracellular Mg(2+) (PubMed:14576148, PubMed:16636202). In contrast, others studies report that TRPM6 does not produce functional currents by itself and TRPM6 does not efficiently form homotetramers channels in the plasma membrane, but requires TRPM7 to be co-targeted to the cell surface (PubMed:14976260, PubMed:17197439). Further, homotetramers TRPM6 are highly sensitive to intracellular free Mg(2+) and therefore unlikely to be active at physiological levels of intracellular Mg(2+) (PubMed:24385424)
C1QT4_HUMAN		There are conflicting results in its involvement in the inflammatory network. It was first described to be a pro-inflammatory cytokine by inducing the activation of NF-kappa-B signaling pathway and up-regulates IL6 production in liver carcinoma cells (PubMed:21658842). While it seems to have the opposite effect in macrophages (PubMed:27086950)
C1QT4_HUMAN		Involvement in food intake and energy was only observed when the protein was externally administered in the brain, but not when this protein was overexpressed in vivo
COPA1_HUMAN		The pyrrolidone carboxylic acid reported in PubMed:11927537 probably formed artifactually from Glu-113 during the extraction procedure in 70% formic acid. In PubMed:15522881, the protein was found to have unblocked Glu at the N-terminus
LDH6B_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-50 is the initiator
TRYD_HUMAN		Although PubMed:11174199 reported this as a pseudogene, PubMed:12391231 showed it is expressed and has proteolytic activity when expressed in bacterial cells
FTO_HUMAN		According to a report, mainly mediates demethylation of N(6),2'-O-dimethyladenosine cap (m6A(m)), by demethylating the N(6)-methyladenosine adjacent to mRNA cap, whereas it has low activity toward internal N(6)-methyladenosine (m6A) in mRNAs (PubMed:28002401). According to a second report, has strong activity toward internal N(6)-methyladenosine (m6A) in mRNAs and is able to demethylate different RNA species, such as tRNA, mRNA or small nuclear RNA (snRNA), depending on the context and subcellular location (PubMed:30197295)
MTMRC_HUMAN		Although it belongs to the non-receptor class myotubularin subfamily, lacks the conserved active site cysteine residue at position 391 in the dsPTPase catalytic loop and does not have phosphatase activity
NMUR2_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-4 is the initiator
MCLN1_HUMAN		There are conflicting results relative to ion selectivity and permeation. Initially outward rectification has been reported which makes the proposed activity as lysosymal Ca(2+) release channel unlikely. Inward rectification has been decribed in later studies supporting the Ca(2+) release activity
CLPB_HUMAN		Despite its gene name, this protein differs in domain structure from bacterial clpB. Bacterial clpB contains two AAA modules, one in the N-terminal part of the protein and one in the C-terminal part, separated by a coiled coil, while vertebrate CLPB contains a single C-terminal AAA region and an N-terminal ANK repeat region which is absent from bacterial clpB
NAT10_HUMAN		A number of papers have reported some protein lysine acetyltransferase activity in vitro (PubMed:14592445, PubMed:17631499, PubMed:19303003, PubMed:26882543, PubMed:27993683, PubMed:30165671). However, most experiments have been performed in vitro using a protein construct lacking the RNA-binding region at the terminus (PubMed:14592445, PubMed:17631499, PubMed:19303003). Recent evidence suggests that NAT10 mainly acts as a RNA cytidine acetyltransferase in vivo (PubMed:30449621)
BRD8_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-32 is the initiator
MAGT1_HUMAN		Although MAGT1 has been reported to be involved in intellectual disability (PubMed:18455129), its pathological role is questionable (PubMed:23871722)
RBM38_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-24 is the initiator
SDCB2_HUMAN		The nuclear speckles location of SDCBP2 is under debate. One study shows that in paraformaldehyde fixed cells, SDCBP2 is highly enriched in nuclear speckles (PubMed:15961997). The same authors investigate subcellular location in living cells and fail to detect SDCBP2 in nuclear speckles, and propose that enrichment in nuclear speckles is fixation-dependent (PubMed:23300061)
VP33B_HUMAN		According to PubMed:18474358, it is autophosphorylated. However, it is not related with protein kinases, suggesting it is phosphorylated by another protein
WNK1_HUMAN		Was named WNK/'with no lysine(K)' because key residues for catalysis, including the lysine involved in ATP binding, are either not conserved or differ compared to the residues described in other kinase family proteins
WNK1_HUMAN		HSN2 was originally thought to be an intronless gene lying within a WNK1 gene intron. It has been shown to be a nervous system-specific exon of WNK1 included in isoform 4 and isoform 5 (PubMed:18521183)
WNK1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-214 is the initiator in isoform 4 and isoform 5
BAFL_HUMAN		In contrast to BANF1, it does not seem to bind DNA
SG196_HUMAN		Although related to the Ser/Thr protein kinase family, has no protein kinase activity and acts as a mannose kinase instead
LDAH_HUMAN		The catalytic activity is unsure despite catalytic sites being conserved (By similarity). May have low cholesterol esterase activity but lack triglyceride lipase activity (By similarity)
METL8_HUMAN		The existence of N(3)-methylcytidine on mRNA is unclear (PubMed:33313824, PubMed:34774131). A report was unable to detect N(3)-methylcytidine formation in mammalian mRNAs using a nucleotide-resolution sequencing approach (PubMed:33313824). According to another publication, METTL8 has no activity on mRNAs and specifically methylates mitochondrial tRNAs (PubMed:34774131)
METL8_HUMAN		A publication reported some nucleolar localization (PubMed:32199293). However, the protein used in this publication used a N-terminal tag, which possibly interferes with the mitochondrial targeting (PubMed:34774131)
AKTIP_HUMAN		Lacks the conserved Cys residue necessary for ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 activity
UNKL_HUMAN		Was termed Unkempt
ELP3_HUMAN		The elongator complex was originally thought to play a role in transcription elongation. However, it is no longer thought to play a direct role in this process and its primary function is thought to be in tRNA modification
ELP3_HUMAN		The relevance of the protein lysine acetyltransferase activity is unclear (PubMed:29415125). The publication reporting acetylation of GJA1 does not provide direct evidence of lysine acetyltransferase activity of ELP3 (By similarity)
CAHM2_HUMAN		It remains controversial whether CALHM2 forms functional homomeric channels
NMUR1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-24 is the initiator
BEX1_HUMAN		Was named BEX2 by some authors
B2L10_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-11 is the initiator
MYO10_HUMAN		Represents an unconventional myosin. This protein should not be confused with the conventional myosin-10 (MYH10)
SPAG4_HUMAN		Although transmembrane domains are strongly predicted, they may rather represent hydrophobic globular domains associated with microtubules
SEM4B_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-6 is the initiator
PRDM8_HUMAN		In disagreement with experimental results in mouse, PubMed:22961547 reports lack of histone methyltransferase activity on core histones generally, and on histone H3 specifically
TOPRS_HUMAN		Was originally thought to bind to the palindromic consensus sequence 5'-TCCCAGCACTTTGGGA-3' and to regulate the transcription of numerous genes in the lung
S35D1_HUMAN		The use of uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP) as a counter-anion is disputed and needs further investigation
OTULL_HUMAN		Although highly similar to the deubiquitinase OTULIN, lacks the conserved active site Cys at position 139 which is replaced by an Asp residue, and does not show deubiquitinase activity
PCMD2_HUMAN		Although the active site residue Ser is conserved, appears to lack catalytic activity in vitro
MIOS_HUMAN		The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of the GATOR2 complex is subject to discussion (PubMed:35831510, PubMed:36528027). According to a report, the GATOR2 complex does not catalyze ubiquitination of the GATOR1 complex (PubMed:35831510). In contrast, another publication showed that the GATOR2 complex mediates ubiquitination of the NPRL2 core component of the GATOR1 complex, leading to GATOR1 inactivation (PubMed:36528027)
MTMR4_HUMAN		Although myotubularins have been classified as Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases (PTP), they are specific phosphoinositides 3-phosphatases and not protein phosphatases
TE2IP_HUMAN		Was reported to participate in the protection of telomeres against non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)-mediated repair in the absence of TERF2 (PubMed:19763083). However, this probably does not corresponds to its primary function and experiments in mouse showed that it is dispensible for such process and is required for repression of homology-directed repair (HDR)
CABP1_HUMAN		The interaction with CACNA1A is described as calcium independent in PubMed:11865310 while it is shown to be acutely calcium dependent in PubMed:14570872. PubMed:12032348 describes a stimulatory effect of CABP1 during agonist-induced intracellular calcium signaling while PubMed:14570872 and PubMed:11865310 show an inhibitory effect
HACD3_HUMAN		Shares some similarity with tyrosine phosphatase proteins but it has probably no phosphatase activity
SOX_HUMAN		Was incorrectly described as originating from rabbit in PubMed:9045710
VGLU1_HUMAN		Martineau M. et al. show that may function as a L-glutamate/H(+) antiporter (By similarity). However, according to Eriksen J. et al., H(+) is an allosteric activator (By similarity)
MBD2_HUMAN		Functional studies (PubMed:10050851, PubMed:10950960, PubMed:12665568) have used a C-terminal fragment of isoform 1 which has been described originally as isoform MBD2b but cannot however be proven by supporting cDNA sequences
NLK_HUMAN		Was reported to form a transcriptional repressor complex with CHD7 and SETDB1 involved in PPARG repression (PubMed:17952062). However, this work was later retracted (PubMed:25358353)
RNF14_HUMAN		Lacks the His residue in the RING-type domain 2 that is one of the conserved features of the family
TRIM1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-21 is the initiator
HSPB8_HUMAN		Was reported to have a protein kinase activity and to act as a Mn(2+)-dependent serine-threonine-specific protein kinase
GDF2_HUMAN		Can promote osteogenic differentiation in vitro (PubMed:25237187, PubMed:25751889). This is probably not physiologically relevant
NOCT_HUMAN		Was initially shown to have low deadenylase activity that was lost when the metal-binding Glu was mutated (By similarity). Later studies showed that the purified protein lacked deadenylase activity (PubMed:29860338, PubMed:30389976). Was subsequently shown to act as a phosphatase (PubMed:31147539)
GRID1_HUMAN		The ligand-gated cation channel activity triggered by glycine and D-serine, first reported in an article, has been a subject of controversy (By similarity). These findings have been challenged by more recent research (PubMed:39052831)
PPT2_HUMAN		Was originally referred as a palmitoyl-protein thioesterase (palmitoyl-protein hydrolase)
CDIN1_HUMAN		Based on sequence similarity, it has been suggested that C15orf41 might encode a divalent metal-ion dependent restriction endonuclease, although nuclease activity could not be experimentally proven
MED16_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-13 is the initiator
COQ6_HUMAN		Based on current literature, utilization of para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA) involving C4-deamination is still unclear, and seems not to occur in bacteria, plants and mammals where only C5 hydroxylation of HHB has been shown, even if human COQ6 is able to support C4-deamination in yeast cells lacking COQ9
WASC3_HUMAN		One study reported a nucleation-promoting factor (NPF) activity towards the Arp2/3 complex using partially purified samples of the WASH complex (PubMed:19922875). In another study, the in vitro reconstituted and purified recombinant WASH core complex, consisting of WASHC3, WASHC4, WASHC5, WASHC1 and the N-terminal residues 1-356 of WASHC2, did not show activity toward Arp2/3 complex (PubMed:20498093)
SIT1_HUMAN		In contrast to its orthologs it harbors a signal sequence
SAMH1_HUMAN		Was intially thought to be allosterically stimulated by dGTP (PubMed:22056990, PubMed:24141705, PubMed:24217394). However, it was later shown that it is allosterically activated and regulated via the combined actions of GTP and dNTPs (dATP, dGTP, dTTP and dCTP), which bind two separate binding sites (PubMed:25267621, PubMed:25288794, PubMed:25760601)
SAMH1_HUMAN		Phosphorylation at Thr-592 was initially thought to impair ability to restrict infection by viruses without affecting the deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTPase) activity (PubMed:23601106). However, it was later shown that phosphorylation reduces the stability of the homotetramer, leading to impair the dNTPase activity (PubMed:26294762, PubMed:26431200)
SAMH1_HUMAN		Was initially thought to have 3'-5' exonuclease activity, acting on single-stranded RNA (PubMed:23364794, PubMed:25038827). A publication also reported some DNA 3'-5' exonuclease activity (PubMed:23364794). However, it was later shown that SAMHD1 does not possess DNA and/or RNA exonuclease activities and that these activities are due to contamination during the purification process that can be removed after chromatography steps (PubMed:26101257). The exonuclease activity observed was maybe due to the presence of MRE11 during the purification steps (PubMed:29670289)
VPP2_HUMAN		The N-terminal peptide may increase IL1B secretion by peripheral blood monocytes; however as this region is probably in the cytosol, the in vivo relevance of this observation needs to be confirmed
STYL1_HUMAN		Lacks the two active site residues His and Cys at position 245 and 246 which are essential for dual-specificity phosphatase activity. Lacks phosphatase activity
DNM3A_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-4 is the initiator
NBDY_HUMAN		Was previously thought to be non-coding but has been shown to be translated and functional
GGT3_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene
TTLL8_HUMAN		TTLL3 and TTLL8 monoglycylase-mediated glycylation of tubulin was initially reported to play a role in ependymal motile ciliary maintenance (By similarity). However, contradictory results were later observed (By similarity)
WASH1_HUMAN		One study reported a nucleation-promoting factor (NPF) activity towards the Arp2/3 complex using partially purified samples of the WASH complex (PubMed:19922875). In another study, the in vitro reconstituted and purified recombinant WASH core complex, consisting of WASHC3, WASHC4, WASHC5, WASHC1 and the N-terminal residues 1-356 of WASHC2, did not show any NPF activity towards the Arp2/3 complex (PubMed:20498093)
DESPR_HUMAN		Was shown to act as a dual endothelin-1/angiotensin-2 receptor in the rat Dahl salt-sensitive strain. However, in the rat Dahl salt-resistant strain and in other species including human and mouse, functions as a dual endothelin-1/VEGF signal peptide receptor and does not act as an angiotensin-2 receptor
IFNL4_HUMAN		The reference genome assembly, GRCh37, describes the non-functional copy of that gene, frameshifted at position 22, that is more frequent in human populations
TLR4_HUMAN		In some plant proteins and in human SARM1, the TIR domain has NAD(+) hydrolase (NADase) activity (PubMed:28334607). However, despite the presence of the catalytic Asp residue, the isolated TIR domain of human TLR4 lacks NADase activity (PubMed:28334607). Based on this, it is unlikely that Toll-like receptors have NADase activity
NDUA4_HUMAN		Was initially believed to be a subunit of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (complex I)
DDX3X_HUMAN		The role of the nuclear export signal (NES) motif in XPO1-mediated DDX3X export is controversial (PubMed:15507209, PubMed:30131165, PubMed:31575075). In one study, NES has been found dispensable for DDX3X export while the helicase domain mediates the interaction with XPO1 (PubMed:15507209). However, in two other studies, DDX3X nuclear export is dependent on both NES and Ran in its GTP-bound form while the helicase domain is not required (PubMed:30131165, PubMed:31575075)
NCKP5_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-26 is the initiator
DPYL4_HUMAN		Lacks most of the conserved residues that are essential for binding the metal cofactor and hence for dihydropyrimidinase activity. Its enzyme activity is therefore unsure
ABCD4_HUMAN		Originally proposed to be a peroxisomal protein (PubMed:9266848). Recent studies have suggested its localization to the endoplasmic reticulum and within the lysosome (PubMed:27456980)
PI51B_HUMAN		There is confusion in the literature with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase type I nomenclature due to the fact that frequently mouse PIP5K1B is named Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase type I alpha
MOT4_HUMAN		Was initially thought to be considered to be a low affinity lactate transporter with negligible affinity for pyruvate (PubMed:11101640). However, it was later shown that SLC16A3 is a high affinity lactate transporter with physiologically relevant affinity for pyruvate (PubMed:31719150)
MOT4_HUMAN		Was initially assigned as monocarboxylate transporter 3 (MCT3) (PubMed:9425115). However, it was later shown that it corresponds to monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4)
P2RX6_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-11 is the initiator
TLR2_HUMAN		In some plant proteins and in human SARM1, the TIR domain has NAD(+) hydrolase (NADase) activity (By similarity). However, despite the presence of the catalytic Asp residue, the isolated TIR domain of human TLR4 lacks NADase activity (By similarity). Based on this, it is unlikely that Toll-like receptors have NADase activity
SEP15_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-4 is the initiator
RAD1_HUMAN		Was reported to possess 3'->5' double stranded DNA exonuclease activity (PubMed:9660799). However, this activity was not confirmed by other publications (PubMed:9716408)
GCYB2_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene
RDH16_HUMAN		Membrane topology is controversial (PubMed:12534290). Membrane topology structure with endoplasmic reticulum lumen orientation of the catalytic domains while the C-terminus is in the cytosol have been suggested (By similarity). Others investigators have argued for a reverse orientation, with a membrane-embedded N-terminal domain but no C-terminal transmembrane segment, and a cytosolic orientation of the catalytic domain (PubMed:12534290). These contradictory results are probably because of differences in the assay systems
EED_HUMAN		Two variants of the PRC2 complex have been described, termed PRC3 and PRC4. Each of the three complexes may include a different complement of EED isoforms, although the precise sequences of the isoforms in each complex have not been determined. The PRC2 and PRC4 complexes may also methylate 'Lys-26' of histone H1 in addition to 'Lys-27' of histone H3 (PubMed:15099518, PubMed:15684044), although other studies have demonstrated no methylation of 'Lys-26' of histone H1 by PRC2 (PubMed:16431907)
RF1M_HUMAN		Was initially thought to not act as a peptide chain release factor because of a sequence insertion in the stop codon-recognition domain that would prevent interactions with the mRNA (PubMed:22569235). However, it was later shown to specifically direct the termination of translation in response to non-canonical termination stop codons AGG and AGA (PubMed:36302763, PubMed:36596788, PubMed:37141370)
TRPM2_HUMAN		The isolated nudix hydrolase domain was shown to have low catalytic activity with ADP-ribose upon heterologous expression (PubMed:11385575). However, a more recent publication demonstrates that the nudix hydrolase domain lacks enzyme activity and suggests that spontaneous degradation of the substrate underlies the previously reported low activity (PubMed:27383051)
GLSK_HUMAN		Isoform 3 is predicted to be expressed at very low levels due to a premature stop codon in the mRNA, leading to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Contrary to expectations, it has been shown to be well expressed, and the encoded protein is detected in mitochondria (PubMed:11015561, PubMed:17940881, PubMed:22228304)
CXL14_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-13 is the initiator
DDAH2_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (with EC:3.5.3.18) able to hydrolyze N(G),N(G)-dimethyl-L-arginine (ADMA) and N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (MMA) (PubMed:10493931). However, a recent multicentre study has shown that DDAH2 does not have dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase activity by using different approaches (PubMed:21493890, PubMed:37296100)
ZBED1_HUMAN		Was first identified as gene weakly similar to Ac transposable elements, but does not code for any transposase activity
OAS1_HUMAN		PubMed:1651324 sequence was originally thought to originate from mouse
CO3_HUMAN		An article reported the interaction surface between C3 and CR2 (PubMed:11387479). According to a another paper, it is however an artifact and can be ascribed to the presence of zinc acetate in the buffer (PubMed:21527715)
CO3_HUMAN		The difference between allele C3S (C3 slow) and allele C3F (C3 fast) was reported to be caused by a an Asn at position 1216 instead of an Asp (PubMed:2473125). The paper was however retracted (PubMed:2584723)
THYG_HUMAN		The cholinesterase-like (ChEL) region lacks the Ser residue of the catalytic triad suggesting that it has no esterase activity

IGHD_HUMAN		For an example of a full-length immunoglobulin delta heavy chain see AC P0DOX3
ESR1_HUMAN		Was reported to be activated by DDX5. However, this study has been retracted due to concerns of image manipulation
C4BPA_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-17 is the initiator
GCR_HUMAN		Had previously been shown to interact with PELP1. However this paper was retracted as cell-based data was viewed as unreliable
PRIO_HUMAN		An isoform was shown to be localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus and to be sumoylated with SUMO1 (PubMed:19059915). The article has later been withdrawn by the authors
UD2B4_HUMAN		UGT2B4 has been previously described as an enzyme named UGT2B11. However the name UGT2B11 has now been reused for another human protein (see AC O75310)
ZFY_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be the testis determining factor (TDF)
CEL3B_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be elastase 1
ADA2A_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-16 is the initiator
IGLC3_HUMAN		For an example of a full-length immunoglobulin lambda light chain see AC P0DOX8
TRBR1_HUMAN		This sequence is an example of a full-length TR beta chain. M/matrix protein 1-specific TRBV19*01J2S7*01C*02 TCR beta chain is generated by somatic recombination of variable TRBV19 (AC A0A075B6N1), diversity (AC P0DPI4) and joining TRBJ2-7 (AC A0A0A0MT78) gene segments spliced to constant TRBC2 (AC A0A5B9) gene segment (PubMed:1833769, PubMed:27036003, PubMed:29997621, PubMed:7807026). CDR3-beta clonotype identifier: sIRSSy.1456B19S1B27L11 (PubMed:19568742)
ANDR_HUMAN		Had previously been shown to interact with PELP1. However this paper was retracted as cell-based data was viewed as unreliable
PABP1_HUMAN		Was termed (Ref.5) polyadenylate binding protein II
PTN_HUMAN		According to a first report, interacts with ALK leading to stimulation of ALK tyrosine phosphorylation (PubMed:11278720). According to a second report, ALK is phosphorylated independently of a direct interaction with PTN but through PTPRZ1 which is inactivated in PTN-stimulated cells; the sites that are autophosphorylated in ALK no longer can be dephosphorylated by PTPRZ1; thus, autoactivation and tyrosine phosphorylation of ALK rapidly increase (PubMed:17681947)
AGT1_HUMAN		The intracellular compartmentalization of AGTX in mammalian hepatocytes is species dependent. In human and rabbit, AGTX is peroxisomal. In new world monkeys (marmoset) and rodents (rat and mouse), it is distributed approximately evenly between peroxisomes and mitochondria. In carnivores, like cat, the great majority of the enzyme is mitochondrial with only a small proportion being peroxisomal
SFPQ_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be myoblast cell surface antigen 24.1D5 and a possible membrane-bound protein ectokinase
PTPRZ_HUMAN		Was termed (PubMed:8387522, PubMed:2170109) RPTPase beta
PTPRZ_HUMAN		The human genome was initially thought to contain 2 genes for PTPRZ: PTPRZ1 (on chr 7) and PTPRZ2 (on chr 1). However, PTPRZ2 probably does not exist and corresponds to PTPRZ1
THAS_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 is the initiator. An alternative upstream Met is found in primates, but not in other mammals
ZA2G_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-4 is the initiator
HGFL_HUMAN		Although related to peptidase S1 family, the active site residues characteristic of serine proteases appear to be absent from this protein, which may therefore lack protease activity
NKTR_HUMAN		A report has suggested that the protein is expressed at the cell surface, associated with the cell membrane via its N-terminus. However, there is no direct evidence for that localization and the properties of the protein argue against it
AKT2_HUMAN		In light of strong identity in the primary amino acid sequence, the 3 AKT kinases were long surmised to play redundant and overlapping roles. However, it is now known that each AKT may display specific functions in different cellular events and diseases. AKT1 is more specifically involved in cellular survival pathways, by inhibiting apoptotic processes; whereas AKT2 is more specific for the insulin receptor signaling pathway. Moreover, while AKT1 and AKT2 are often implicated in many aspects of cellular transformation, the 2 isoforms act in a complementary opposing manner. The role of AKT3 is less clear, though it appears to be predominantly expressed in brain
FCG2C_HUMAN		Has sometimes been attributed to correspond to FcR-IIB
FCG2C_HUMAN		FCGR2C is both a gene and a pseudogene in the human population, the reference genome corresponding currently to the non-functional allele with a stop codon at position 57. The sequence shown here with a Gln at that position is the one of the functional protein
ABCD1_HUMAN		Variants Trp-88, Cys-152, Cys-181, Ser-343, Pro-503, Arg-514 and His-554 have original been associated with ALD. However this paper was retracted due to inconsistencies in a confirmation immunoblot that could not be validated from the originally published data
CAH8_HUMAN		Although it belongs to the alpha-carbonic anhydrase family, Arg-116 is present instead of the conserved His which is a zinc-binding residue. It is therefore expected that this protein lacks carbonic anhydrase activity
CTNB1_HUMAN		A paper showing an interaction with TBP and phosphorylation at Tyr-86 and Tyr-654 has been retracted due to panel duplication in several figures
T2FA_HUMAN		Was reported to have a protein kinase activity and to autophosphorylates on Ser-385 and Thr-389
MYH10_HUMAN		Represents a conventional non-muscle myosin. This protein should not be confused with the unconventional myosin-10 (MYO10)
BRCA1_HUMAN		An article that concluded that AURKA-mediated phosphorylation of BRCA1 Ser-308 plays a role in the normal cell cycle G2/M transition was withdrawn due to data manipulation of flow cytometry data
TPOR_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-8 is the initiator
ADH7_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-13 is the initiator
STAT3_HUMAN		Was shown to be S-palmitoylated by ZDHHC19, leading to STAT3 homodimerization. However, this study was later retracted
EIF2D_HUMAN		Was previously erroneously called ligatin, a trafficking receptor for phosphoglycoproteins, while ligatin is actually a distinct 10 kDa filamentous membrane protein encoded by a still unidentified gene
M3K8_HUMAN		A paper describing a role for this protein in IRAK1-independent activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway in response to IL1 has been retracted, because some of the experimental data could not be reproduced
FOLR3_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-3 is the initiator
CDN2A_HUMAN		The proteins described here are encoded by the gene CDKN2A, but are completely unrelated in terms of sequence and function to tumor suppressor ARF (AC Q8N726) which is encoded by the same gene
MAGA6_HUMAN		In vitro experiments measuring cell viability in melanoma cell lines used siRNA specific for MAGEA3 and MAGEA6
ACOT2_HUMAN		Was originally (PubMed:10944470) thought to be peroxisomal but was later shown (PubMed:16940157) to be mitochondrial
HINT1_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a protein kinase C inhibitor and to bind zinc in solution. Both seem to be incorrect
UB2D1_HUMAN		PubMed:9362508 cloned and sequenced SFT which consisted of UBE2D1 last coding exon along with intronic sequences on the 5'-end of this exon. A function in iron transport has been described
STA5B_HUMAN		It was reported that dephosphorylation on tyrosine residues by PTPN2 would negatively regulate prolactin signaling pathway (PubMed:11773439). However, the corresponding article has been retracted (PubMed:24319783)
DYLT3_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a candidate for RP3
ZNF41_HUMAN		Although ZNF41 has been reported to be involved in X-linked intellectual disability (PubMed:14628291), its pathological role is questionable (PubMed:23871722)
MVD1_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be located in the peroxisome (PubMed:11108725). However, was later shown to be cytosolic (PubMed:14972328)
PTN5_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-25 is the initiator
FOXG1_HUMAN		PubMed:7959731 claims that there are 3 different FOXG1 proteins, FOXG1A, FOXG1B, and FOXG1C. It was latter found that there is only one gene and the differences between these three may be sequencing errors since the protein is coded in a unique exon
WNT3A_HUMAN		A palmitoylation site was proposed at Cys-77, but it was later shown that this cysteine is engaged in a disulfide bond (PubMed:24292069)
EPIPL_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-26 is the initiator
HILS1_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene. However, mouse (AC Q9QYL0) and rat (AC D3ZZW6) orthologs encode functional proteins
EFC1_HUMAN		CKS-17 sequence does not match the minimal active consensus
IF4G2_HUMAN		According to PubMed:9049310, this sequence initiates exclusively at a GTG codon
EM55_HUMAN		Thought to be palmitoylated by ZDHHC17 (PubMed:22496366). This work was later retracted due to image manipulation (PubMed:29475958)
RUNX1_HUMAN		The fusion of AML1 with EAP in T-MDS induces a change of reading frame in the latter resulting in 17 AA unrelated to those of EAP
ROR1_HUMAN		The kinase domain has very low catalytic activity in vitro
PTH1R_HUMAN		Was shown to interact with G protein subunit GNB1 and GNG2, the interaction was reduced by mutation of Trp-474 and Trp-477. However this paper was retracted due to a lack of clear and continous electron density in the complex structure
PTH1R_HUMAN		PubMed:11850620 suggests PTH1R involvement in multiple enchondromatosis. However, PubMed:15523647 shows evidence that this disease is not caused by PTH1R
C1QBP_HUMAN		The subcellular location has been matter of debate. After being reported to be exclusively localized to mitochondria, demonstrations of promiscuous associations and locations were considered as artifactual due to the extremely acidic character and the use of different tagged versions of the protein (PubMed:11493647, PubMed:9305894). However, its location to multiple compartments linked to diverse functions is now accepted. The N-termini of the surface and secreted forms are identical to the reported processed mitochondrial form
KLC1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-5 is the initiator
PCDH1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-23 is the initiator
MPPA_HUMAN		Does not seem to have protease activity as it lacks the zinc-binding site
FOXF1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-26 is the initiator
ILK_HUMAN		Was originally thought to act as a serine/threonine-protein kinase (PubMed:8538749). Now thought to be a pseudokinase which does not have kinase activity and which functions solely as a scaffold protein (PubMed:20005845, PubMed:21524996, PubMed:30367047)
MTMR1_HUMAN		The activity toward phosphatidylinositol (3,5)-bisphosphate is controversial as it was also tested in vitro by Kim et al., but was not detected
ALKB1_HUMAN		The DNA N6-methyl adenine demethylase activity is subject to discussion. According to a report, biochemical assays do not reveal clear DNA N6-methyl adenine demethylase activity in vivo (PubMed:27745969). According to another study, has clear DNA N6-methyl adenine demethylase activity (PubMed:30017583)
TTL12_HUMAN		Although it belongs to the tubulin--tyrosine ligase family, the TTL domain lacks some of the ATP binding sites predicted to be essential for TTL activity (PubMed:23251473). Lacks tyrosine ligase activity in vitro (PubMed:23251473). Lacks glutamylation activity in vitro (By similarity). Although TTLL12 contains a potential SET-like domain in the N-terminus, it does not have lysine methyltransferase activity towards histone in vitro (PubMed:23251473)
DPYL3_HUMAN		Lacks most of the conserved residues that are essential for binding the metal cofactor and hence for dihydropyrimidinase activity. Its enzyme activity is therefore unsure
FKBP8_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-58 is the initiator
NF2L1_HUMAN		According to a report, processing following retrotranslocation is dependent on the proteasome (PubMed:24998528). However, it was later shown that processing takes place in a proteasome-independent manner (PubMed:27676297, PubMed:27676298)
NF2L1_HUMAN		Its topology is subject to discussion. According to some groups, it has a single-pass type II membrane protein in normal conditions and is retrotranslocated into a single-pass type III membrane protein in response to stress (PubMed:24448410). According to other reports, it is integrated into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane via multiple membrane-spanning alpha-helices
NF2L1_HUMAN		Was initially thought to activate erythroid-specific, globin gene expression (PubMed:8036168). Knockout experiments in mouse however demonstrated that it is not the case
S29A2_HUMAN		The nuclear function of SLC29A2/ENT2 is unclear. A study reported that under proliferative conditions, two SLC29A2/ENT2 nuclear isoforms recruited SLC29A2/ENT2 to the nuclear envelope in order to translocate nucleosides into the nucleus for incorporation into DNA during replication (PubMed:27271752). However, the physiological existence of these isoforms has yet to be proven
HS902_HUMAN		Despite classification as a pseudogene, the existence of this protein is supported by unambiguous mass spectrometry evidence
LTBP2_HUMAN		A publication reported that a complex is formed with TGFB1 (PubMed:7798248). According to another report, there is no association with TGFB1 (PubMed:10930463)
SUZ12_HUMAN		Two variants of the PRC2 complex have been described, termed PRC3 and PRC4. Each of the three complexes may include a different complement of EED isoforms, although the precise sequences of the isoforms in each complex have not been determined. The PRC2 and PRC4 complexes may also methylate 'Lys-26' of histone H1 in addition to 'Lys-27' of histone H3 (PubMed:15099518, PubMed:15684044), although other studies have demonstrated no methylation of 'Lys-26' of histone H1 by PRC2 (PubMed:16431907)
MLC1_HUMAN		Was initially predicted to function as cation channel based on marginal amino acid sequence homology with a voltage-gated K+ channel KCNA1
LRC41_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-23 is the initiator
OGR1_HUMAN		Was originally (PubMed:10806476) thought to be a receptor for sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC). However, this work has been retracted (PubMed:16508674)
TAB1_HUMAN		Lacks several key residues involved in metal-binding and catalytic activity, therefore has lost phosphatase activity
STK11_HUMAN		Its phosphorylation by PKC/PRKCZ at Ser-428 is reported to promote peroxynitrite-induced nuclear export of STK11, leading to PTEN activation and subsequent inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling and induction of apoptosis in vein endothelial cells (PubMed:18321849). However this paper was withdrawn by the authors due to concerns of image duplication in the figures. Its phosphorylation by PKC/PRKCZ has been confirmed in other studies (PubMed:18854309, PubMed:23612973)
PSMD5_HUMAN		Was initially identified as a genuine component of the 26S proteasome
UGPA_HUMAN		The human genome was initially thought to contain 2 genes for UTP--glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase: UGP1 and UGP2 (PubMed:8354390, PubMed:8631325). However, the sequence defined as UGP1 (PubMed:8354390) probably does not exist and corresponds to UGP2
MSS51_HUMAN		Although no clear MSS51 ortholog is encoded in mammalian genomes, the mammalian MSS51/ZMYND17 protein is significantly similar. Considered by a number of resources to be the ortholog of yeast MSS51
FAKD1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-15 is the initiator
EXOS6_HUMAN		The six exosome core subunits containing a RNase PH-domain are not phosphorolytically active
PI5L1_HUMAN		It is unsure if the enzyme has intrinsic kinase activity
CP4AM_HUMAN		Was originally termed CYP4A11
OBSCN_HUMAN		Initially the name obscurin was used to describe isoform 3 which lacks the kinase domains
FOCAD_HUMAN		Focadhesin is predicted to contain three transmembrane domains. However, experimental data indicate that it does not localize to organelles with bilayered lipid membranes, challenging the presence of the transmembrane domains
WAC2A_HUMAN		A WASHC2C construct with WASHC2A-specific sequence insertions has been used in a number of experiments; the results are included in the WASHC2C entry
HMBX1_HUMAN		Reported to have transcriptional repression activity in vitro (PubMed:16825764, PubMed:19757162). However, it is unclear whether this protein has any function in transcription in vivo
RHBD2_HUMAN		Although strongly related to the peptidase S54 family, it lacks the conserved active sites, suggesting that it has no peptidase activity
UFSP1_HUMAN		UFSP1 initiates at a non-canonical GUG codon (PubMed:35525273, PubMed:35926457). Was initially thought to initiate from Met-77 and constitute a inactive isopeptidase that lacks a functional protease domain (PubMed:35525273, PubMed:35926457)
ZNT6_HUMAN		Hydrophilic histidine residues that participate to zinc binding in transporters of the family are not conserved in SLC30A6
WDR59_HUMAN		The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of the GATOR2 complex is subject to discussion (PubMed:35831510, PubMed:36528027). According to a report, the GATOR2 complex does not catalyze ubiquitination of the GATOR1 complex (PubMed:35831510). In contrast, another publication showed that the GATOR2 complex mediates ubiquitination of the NPRL2 core component of the GATOR1 complex, leading to GATOR1 inactivation (PubMed:36528027)
LARP1_HUMAN		Conflicting results are reported regarding the interaction with PABPC1. Some studies found that the interaction depends on the presence of mRNA (PubMed:23711370, PubMed:28650797). Others found that the interaction is direct and does not depend on the presence of mRNA (PubMed:20430826, PubMed:24532714, PubMed:25940091)
SAMD1_HUMAN		Due to its high GC content it turned out to be difficult to sequence the 5' end of the gene encoding the N-terminal proline-rich region of the protein and to unambiguously determine which sequence is correct. We display the sequence described in PubMed:16159594. This sequence fits better with orthologous sequences but is not consistent with the human reference genome sequence
UQCC3_HUMAN		Was initially reported to be secreted (PubMed:15340161). However, it was later shown to be localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane (PubMed:25008109, PubMed:25605331)
KSR2_HUMAN		KSR2 binds ATP and has very low in vitro protein kinase activity; the physiological relevance of this activity is unknown. KSR2 is proposed to be in an inactive conformation by itself or in complex with MAP2K1. Interaction with BRAF is proposed to induce a conformation change that increases the low intrinsic kinase activity (PubMed:21441910)
HACD2_HUMAN		Shares some similarity with tyrosine phosphatase proteins but it has probably no phosphatase activity
KAT3_HUMAN		The first non-coding exon of CCBL2 is in common with that of RBMXL1
BGIN_HUMAN		Translation initiation occurs at a non-canonical CUG codon
H1FNT_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-22 is the initiator
CHST9_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-8 is the initiator
PLPR4_HUMAN		Originally described as a 2-lysophosphatidate/LPA phosphatase (PubMed:12730698). However, following studies suggested it does not have such activity or only a residual one (PubMed:15280885). This is further supported by the fact that the phosphatase sequence motifs as well as the His residue acting as a nucleophile in active phosphatases of the PA-phosphatase related phosphoesterase family are not conserved (PubMed:15280885)
PK1L3_HUMAN		PKD1L3 and PKD2L1 have been defined as sour taste receptor in gustatory cells based on a number of indirect evidences in mouse. Some data confirm this hypothesis in human: in 2 patients with sour ageusia that are unresponsive to sour stimuli, but show normal responses to bitter, sweet, and salty stimuli, expression of PKD1L3 and PKD2L1 is absent in the anterior part of the tongue (PubMed:19812697). However, a number of experiments have recently shown that the sour taste receptor activity is probably indirect
GLTL5_HUMAN		In contrast to other members of the family, lacks the C-terminal ricin B-type lectin domain, which contributes to the glycopeptide specificity. No glycosyltransferase activity has been detected in an in vitro assay (PubMed:24398516)
VTCN1_HUMAN		The mouse ortholog has been shown to be a GPI-anchored protein but the Gly residue which is predicted to be the modified site in mouse and rat is not conserved in human
AGRE4_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene. A point deletion in exon 8, which introduces a frame shift leading to a premature stop codon. Thus, a protein expressed by this gene would be soluble rather than expressed on the cell surface. This single-nucleotide deletion has been acquired after human-chimpanzee speciation, about five million years ago
TPC6B_HUMAN		May not be essential for endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport
ATL2_HUMAN		Although strongly similar to members of the ADAMTS family it lacks the metalloprotease and disintegrin-like domains which are typical of that family
ATG4D_HUMAN		A paper describing ATG4D tissue expression has been retracted, due to concerns of image duplication in some of the figures
UBP48_HUMAN		Was termed (PubMed:15354349, PubMed:17081983) USP31
ITIH5_HUMAN		Conflict in position 933 in the human genome assembly due to a frameshift
TRXR3_HUMAN		This sequence initiates at a CTG codon
NLRC5_HUMAN		Supposed to contain a CARD domain at the N-terminus (PubMed:20434986). However, this domain is not detected by Pfam, PROSITE or SMART. Has a weak similarity with a DAPIN domain
PRAG1_HUMAN		Despite of the presence of a putative ATP-binding motif, this protein does not bind ATP, suggesting that it has no protein kinase activity
CERS3_HUMAN		Contains a predicted homeobox domain which is degenerated, lacking residues important for DNA-binding. Moreover, the protein localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum and not in the nucleus, which also argues against homeobox function (By similarity)
AT2L2_HUMAN		Does not seem to possess aminotransferase activity
VRK3_HUMAN		Inactive as a kinase due to its inability to bind ATP
ZN547_HUMAN		The gene of ZNF547 share a non-coding exon with TRAPPC2P
HOMEZ_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-25 is the initiator
CC146_HUMAN		A report observed N-glycosylation at Asn-815 (PubMed:19139490). However, as the protein is not predicted to localize in an extracellular compartment of the cell, additional evidence is required to confirm this result
AGRF2_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene. Protein coding orthologs in other vertebrate species
PELP1_HUMAN		There was previous evidence for interactions with AR, NR3C1 and ESR2. However this paper was retracted as cell-based data was viewed as unreliable
CLASR_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-16 is the initiator
METL4_HUMAN		The existence of N(6)-methyladenosine on DNA is unclear in mammals (PubMed:32203414). According to a report, the majority of N(6)-methyladenosine in DNA originates from RNA catabolism via a nucleotide salvage pathway and is misincorporated by DNA polymerases, arguing against a role as epigenetic DNA mark in mammalian cells (PubMed:32203414). Additional evidences are therefore required to confirm the role of METTL4 as a N(6)-adenine-specific DNA methyltransferase in vivo (PubMed:32203414)
GLT15_HUMAN		Was originally termed Galnt15/pp-GaNTase 15
PAQR4_HUMAN		Seems to not act as a 'classical' recpetor. Initially described as a ceramidase, recent evidence disputes this direct ceramidase activity. Instead, it suggests that PAQR4 regulates ceramide levels through its interaction with ceramide synthetases
OGFD1_HUMAN		According to a report, it is incorporated into stress granules upon arsenite-induced stress and associates with heme-regulated kinase and eIF-2-alpha (EIF2S1) in regulating eIF-2-alpha phosphorylation (PubMed:20154146). However, no effect in eIF-2-alpha phosphorylation have been observed by another study (PubMed:24550447)
ADGB_HUMAN		The calpain domain lacks the conserved active site residues. Probably catalytically inactive as a calcium-dependent cysteine-type endopeptidase
FNDC5_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-76 is the initiator. Some transcript evidence points at Met-76. In this short version of the protein, the signal peptide cannot be predicted and the irisin peptide is severely truncated. The first initiation codon corresponds to a non-AUG site, an N-terminal ATA codon. This initiation codon has been annotated as it is in good Kozak context and it is conserved in other primates, including gibbon, chimpanzee and gorilla. Although the existence of such a form has not been demonstrated in human, western blot analysis following endurance exercise shows the presence of an irisin peptide of similar size in human and mouse plasma (PubMed:22237023), suggesting the existence of full-length irisin in human, at least in some tissues. However, expression from Met-1 may be less efficient than that from Met-76 (PubMed:24040023). A further alternative to the putative N-terminal ATA codon as the initiation site is provided by an upstream transcription start site, which allows use of a highly conserved AUG initiation codon
XXLT1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-14 is the initiator
IL17D_HUMAN		IL17D nucleotide sequence has been submitted under the name IL27 in INSDC AY078238 (Ref.2). However, the protein shown in this entry should not be confused with the actual IL27 protein, which forms a heterodimeric cytokine by interaction with EBI3. In order to avoid any ambiguity, we strongly recommend using the official HGNC nomenclature
RDH11_HUMAN		In contrast to mouse, human RDH11 exhibits little or no activity towards toxic lipid peroxidation products, such as nonanal or 4-hydroxy-nonenal
S26A7_HUMAN		Although it is an anion channel, according to PubMed:12736153 and PubMed:32119864 it has been shown to exhibit chloride-bicarbonate exchanger activity
PHF10_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-89 is the initiator
TM174_HUMAN		A previous study found the localization of TMEM174 in the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:20331980). A more recent study detected TMEM174 in cell membrane (PubMed:35459732). The difference between these two studies could be due to the use of different cell lines
SEN15_HUMAN		Although only weakly related to the S.cerevisiae SEN15 protein, it probably displays the same function within the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex
DYDC1_HUMAN		Sequence AAQ84766 was incorrectly indicated as originating from mouse
TOPB1_HUMAN		Interaction with phosphorylated MDC1 was initially thought to be mediated by BRCT domains 4 and 5 (PubMed:23891287). However, it was later shown to be mainly mediated by BRCT domains 1 and 2 (PubMed:30898438)
MY18A_HUMAN		The TIAF1 protein is coded in the 3'-UTR region of MYO18A
FCGRB_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene
SYN2_HUMAN		There are several mRNAs and ESTs supporting this gene model. However, the genome sequence encoding the N-terminal part contains several sequence discrepancies
SC65_HUMAN		Was originally identified in the nucleolus (PubMed:8862517). A recent publication found it only in the endoplasmic reticulum, which agrees with its biological function and the predicted signal sequence (PubMed:23959653)
MYDGF_HUMAN		Was originally thought to signal lymphoid cells to proliferate via thymic shared antigen 1 (PubMed:11714798). This work was later retracted (PubMed:12538725)
MYDGF_HUMAN		It has been reported that MYDGF is secreted into blood plasma and localized to the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (PubMed:17362502, PubMed:25581518). However, another report shows resident localization to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus and secretion when the two most C-terminal residues of the RTEL motif are abolished (PubMed:29954947)
S38A4_HUMAN		There is a disagreement about sodium-independent transport of cationic amino acids, such as L-arginine and L-lysine. While Hatanaka et al (PubMed:11342143) shown that SLC38A4 may mediate sodium-independent transport of cationic amino acids, such as L-arginine and L-lysine (PubMed:11342143). Recent studies by Fairweather et al (PubMed:33928121), using quantitative LC-MS analysis, shown any transport activity of cationic amino acids, such as L-arginine and L-lysine (PubMed:33928121)
AZIN2_HUMAN		Was initially reported to have ornithine decarboxylase (PubMed:11587527) or arginine decarboxylase (PubMed:14738999) activities, but it was later found that the mouse ortholog does not possess either of them
OTUL_HUMAN		The key substrates of OTULIN and where OTULIN acts to limit inflammation have been subject to discussion. According to some reports, OTULIN plays active roles in TNF or NOD2 receptor signaling complexes (RSCs) by directly deubiquitinating proteins in these complexes (PubMed:26997266, PubMed:27523608). A publication also suggested that OTULIN directly mediates deubiquitination of RIPK2 (PubMed:23806334). However, a publication reported that OTULIN function is restricted to homeostasis of the LUBAC complex, because it is not stably associated with TNF or NOD2 receptor signaling complexes (RSCs) (PubMed:26670046). The main function of OTULIN in deubiquitinating the LUBAC complex was confirmed by knockin experiments in mouse
CHP3_HUMAN		Although PubMed:12809501 reports that TESC results in a decrease in transporter activity of human SLC9A1, studies with rat SLC9A1 show that TESC-binding results in the maturation and accumulation of SLC9A1 at the cell surface
CHP3_HUMAN		The interacting region of SLC9A1/NHE1 with CHP3 is conflicting: Interaction with SLC9A1/NHE1 has been reported via residues 503-545, the juxtamembrane region of the cytoplasmic C-terminus (PubMed:11696366, PubMed:18321853, PubMed:30287853). However, another publication has reported interaction with SLC9A1/NHE1 via residues 633-815, the region of the cytoplasmic C-terminus more distal to the membrane (PubMed:12809501)
KBP_HUMAN		Was originally shown to localize in the mitochondrion and to play a role in mitochondrial transport (PubMed:16225668). Recent articles, however, have shown that it does not localize to mitochondria, it interacts with the cytoskeleton and does not have a role in mitochondrial function (PubMed:20621975, PubMed:23427148)
INKA1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-3 is the initiator
PLPR2_HUMAN		Has most probably no phospholipid phosphatase activity (By similarity). This is supported by the fact that the phosphatase sequence motifs as well as the His residue acting as a nucleophile in active phosphatases of the PA-phosphatase related phosphoesterase family are not conserved (By similarity)
DDX27_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-32 is the initiator
TONSL_HUMAN		Was reported to share sequence similarities with IKBKB and therefore named 'NF-kappa-B inhibitor-like protein 2' (PubMed:7738005). However, the sequence similarity is remote and effects as regulator of NF-kappa-B are probably indirect and require additional evidence (PubMed:9242696)
LRCH3_HUMAN		Predicted to contain a signal peptide and to be secreted. However, this is not consistent with an interaction with DOCK7 and MYO6 and the suggested function in cytoskeleton organization
B3GT6_HUMAN		PubMed:9892646 describes the wrong protein; the cDNAs used had been switched inadvertently
PCMD1_HUMAN		Although the active site residue Ser is conserved, appears to lack catalytic activity in vitro
JKIP1_HUMAN		Was originally thought to bind single-stranded RNA molecules and regulate GABA-B receptor expression
SYGP1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-16 is the initiator methionine
PSKH2_HUMAN		Asn-183 is present instead of the conserved Asp which is expected to be an active site residue
SIG11_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-13 is the initiator
TRIB3_HUMAN		The role of this protein in Akt activation has been demonstrated by Du et al (PubMed:12791994) for the mouse ortholog but Iynedjian (PubMed:15469416) has not been able to reproduce the result in rat hepatocytes
LMF1_HUMAN		Additional evidence for its localization to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane was found. However this paper was retracted due to manipulation of data
ATOH8_HUMAN		Contains a degenerate basic motif not likely to bind DNA
GPER1_HUMAN		Data is conflicting regarding whether it fulfills the criteria of a membrane-bound estrogen receptor (PubMed:15705806, PubMed:17379646). Other reports suggest that it is not (PubMed:16645038, PubMed:18566127)
GPER1_HUMAN		Data is conflicting regarding whether it is localized either at the cell membrane (PM) (PubMed:15539556, PubMed:21149639, PubMed:21354433, PubMed:21427217, PubMed:21540189, PubMed:23674134). Other reports suggest that it localizes at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (PubMed:15705806, PubMed:18566127)
CTIP_HUMAN		Upon DNA damage, was shown to interact with SIRT6 resulting in its deacetylation. However, this study was later retracted
SGMR1_HUMAN		The NMR solution structure identifies a second transmembrane helix starting with Gly-91 (PubMed:25647032). The X-ray structure clearly shows that this region is not helical and not in the membrane; instead it is part of two beta-strands (PubMed:27042935)
RHXF2_HUMAN		RHOF2 and RHOF2B are arranged in a head-to-head orientation and share high sequence similarity (>99%). They cannot easily be distinguished and are usually analyzed as a single gene
PHAF1_HUMAN		Was originally (Ref.1) thought to be a lin-10 homolog
ALKB7_HUMAN		Was initially reported to localize both in cytoplasm and nucleus (PubMed:17979886). However, it was later shown it localizes in mitochondrion (PubMed:23666923). The discrepancy is probably due to the use of a fusion protein with an N-terminal tag in the initial report (PubMed:17979886)
PAGR1_HUMAN		The terminology of MLL proteins in mammalia is not consistent also concerning the terminology of MLL protein-containing complexes. The decribed MLL2/MLL3 complex is commonly described as MLL3/MLL4 complex in literature
EDEM2_HUMAN		Has similarity to alpha 1,2-mannosidases, but the catalytic activity of this protein is controversial (PubMed:15537790, PubMed:25092655). One study shows that it is important for a specific oligosaccharide trimming step from Man9GlcNAc2 to Man8GlcNAc2, suggesting activity as a mannosidase (PubMed:25092655). However, another study reports that this protein has no mannosidase activity (PubMed:15537790)
CAR10_HUMAN		Supposed to contain a SH3, a PDZ and a guanylate kinase-like domain. But none of these 3 domains are detected by PROSITE, Pfam or SMART
STK31_HUMAN		Ser-854 is present instead of the conserved Asp which is expected to be an active site residue
BEX2_HUMAN		Was named BEX1 by some authors
TMPSD_HUMAN		Was termed TMPRSS6 (Ref.3)
YTHD1_HUMAN		Was initially reported to act as a regulator of mRNA translation efficiency by promoting ribosome loading to m6A-containing mRNAs and by interacting with translation initiation factors eIF3 (EIF3A or EIF3B), thereby facilitating translation initiation (PubMed:26046440, PubMed:26593424). These studies suggested that the 3 different paralogs (YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3) have unique functions with limited redundancy (PubMed:26046440, PubMed:26593424). However, later studies showed that YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3 paralogs have redundant functions to a profound extent and directly promote degradation of m6A-containing mRNAs (PubMed:32492408). The effect on translation efficiency observed earlier is probably indirect (PubMed:32492408)
HELZ2_HUMAN		PubMed:12189208 experiments have been carried out partly in rat and partly in human
HELZ2_HUMAN		This sequence initiates at a non-canonical GUG codon
WNK3_HUMAN		According to a report, isoform 1 inhibits the activity of SLC12A3/NCC (PubMed:19470686). According to another publication, it stimulates the activity of SLC12A3/NCC (PubMed:21613606)
WNK3_HUMAN		Was named WNK/'with no lysine(K)' because key residues for catalysis, including the lysine involved in ATP binding, are either not conserved or differ compared to the residues described in other kinase family proteins
STK33_HUMAN		Was initially thought to be required for the survival of mutant KRAS-dependent cell lines (PubMed:19490892). However, it was later shown that it is not essential for the survival of KRAS-dependent AML cell lines (PubMed:21742770)
GTR11_HUMAN		Has been described as GLUT10 in literature, but this gene name has already been used for SLC2A10
TTYH3_HUMAN		According to PubMed:34385445, lacks Ca(2+)-activated chloride channel and swelling-dependent volume-regulated anion channel activities
MLP3B_HUMAN		PubMed:12740394 has shown that the protein is cleaved at Lys-122 but PubMed:15355958 has shown that the cleavage site is at Gly-120 as in other mammalian orthologs
INT2_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-9 is the initiator. Orthologous sequences (mouse and chicken) have shorter N-terminus
DUS15_HUMAN		Although assigned as two separate genes (c20orf57 and DUSP15), it is probable that C20orf57 does not exist by itself and is a part of the DUSP15 gene
O51E2_HUMAN		Contradictory results have been reported for activation of this receptor by beta-ionone in human and mouse. Beta-ionone does not activate OR51E2 in mouse. This difference may depend on the different methods used for the experiment or may be due to species difference
CHST8_HUMAN		PubMed:10988300 reports the possible existence of a secreted isoform starting at Met-119. However, they do not provide any experimental evidence
S2532_HUMAN		Initially postulated to transport folate based on complementation evidence, but it was latter shown to rather function as a FAD transporter indirectly affecting folate levels and folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism in mitochondria
TTYH1_HUMAN		According to PubMed:34385445, lacks swelling-dependent volume-regulated anion channel activity
CAPAM_HUMAN		The role of N(6),2'-O-dimethyladenosine cap (m6A(m)) on transcripts is unclear and subject to discussion (PubMed:30467178, PubMed:31279658, PubMed:31279659). According to a report, m6A(m) promotes translation of capped mRNAs (PubMed:30467178). In contrast, another study did not observe a clear effect on mRNA translation, but reported an increased stability of a subset of m6A(m) transcripts (PubMed:31279658). According to a third report, m6A(m) inhibits mRNA translation without affecting mRNA stability (PubMed:31279659)
ARMT1_HUMAN		Has been reportedly associated with a protein carboxyl methyltransferase activity, but whether this protein indeed has such an activity remains to be determined (PubMed:25732820). It has been later shown to belong to a family of metal-dependent phosphatases implicated in metabolite damage-control (PubMed:27322068)
SGK2_HUMAN		Not regulated by serum or glucocorticoids
NEK6_HUMAN		A paper showing a role in tumorigenesis has been retracted due to panel duplication in several figures
GDPD2_HUMAN		The catalytic domain of GDPD2 is oriented extracellularly; Glycerophosphoinositol is hydrolyzed in the medium of cells overexpressing Gdpd2, whereas intracellular levels of glycerophosphoinositol is not affected
S10AE_HUMAN		Part of the residues that are essential for calcium binding are not conserved, resulting in loss of calcium binding at physiological calcium concentrations
AT131_HUMAN		Was initially thought to mediate manganese transport (PubMed:24392018). However, it was later shown to specifically bind moderately hydrophobic transmembrane with short hydrophilic lumenal domains that misinsert into the endoplasmic reticulum (PubMed:32973005)
BPIA1_HUMAN		Reported to bind to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro (PubMed:15158712, PubMed:27145151). However, the in vivo significance of this is uncertain since other studies indicate little or no specificity for LPS (PubMed:12920053, PubMed:25223608)
EXOS4_HUMAN		The six exosome core subunits containing a RNase PH-domain are not phosphorolytically active
C1QR1_HUMAN		Has been sometimes referred to as a collectin receptor
C1QR1_HUMAN		PubMed:11994479 reported that C1q is not a ligand for C1QR1
IFT46_HUMAN		Has been termed C11orf2, but is not the official C11orf2 as defined by HGNC
ASAH2_HUMAN		Was proposed to be mitochondrial, based on experiments with an N-terminal GFP-tag (PubMed:10781606). The in vivo localization to the mitochondrion could not be confirmed (PubMed:15845354). However, it has been observed for the mouse (AC Q9JHE3) and rat (AC Q91XT9) orthologs
S22AB_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be involved in both the uptake and efflux of glutarate, thereby acting as a bidirectional organic anion:dicarboxylate exchanger (PubMed:15037815). However, another study did not show any significant uptake of glutarate by SLC22A11/OAT4 (PubMed:17229912). Although initial results showed that SLC22A11/OAT4 drove DHEA-S and E1S uptake in a Na(+)-independent manner (PubMed:10660625), further studies demonstrated that both the uptake of DHEA-S and E1S by SLC22A11/OAT4 was partly Na(+)-dependent (about 50%) (PubMed:10660625, PubMed:18501590). The mechanism of SLC22A11/OAT4-mediated transport of E1S is unclear. Most studies have demonstrated a translocation of E1S through the plasma membrane into the cytosol, which would highlight a role of SLC22A11/OAT4 in placental and renal absorption (PubMed:10660625, PubMed:15037815, PubMed:17229912, PubMed:18501590, PubMed:26277985). Instead, SLC22A11/OAT4 was later proposed to mediate both the insertion into and the extraction from the plasma membrane of E1S without being translocated into the cytosol (PubMed:28027879)
RM39_HUMAN		Ref.1 indicates C21orf8 as a synonym for this orf, this is incorrect, C21orf8 is already assigned to another chromosome 21 region
RM39_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-6 is the initiator
UGGG2_HUMAN		Has no enzymatic activity towards unfolded RNase B or thyroglobulin
PEN2_HUMAN		The high-resolution electron microscopy structures indicate that the N-terminus is cytoplasmic, followed by two short helices that dip into the membrane, but do not cross it (PubMed:26280335). In contrast, results based on mutagenesis to create N-glycosylation sites indicate that the N-terminus is lumenal (PubMed:12639958, PubMed:30598546, PubMed:30630874). Both studies indicate that the C-terminus is lumenal (PubMed:12639958, PubMed:26280335)
KLK14_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-17 is the initiator
FRS1L_HUMAN		Named FRRS1L by HGNC because it shares limited sequence similarity with FRRS1. However, sequence similarities lie outside of the reductase region, suggesting it has no oxidoreductase activity
SEM5B_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-59 is the initiator
FRM4A_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-16 is the initiator
SUN2_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-50 is the initiator
TSP50_HUMAN		Although related to peptidase S1 family, lacks the conserved active Ser residue in position 310 which is replaced by a Thr
BAZ1B_HUMAN		Was shown to interact with VDR and with acetylated histones via its Bromo domain, but this work has later been retracted
BL1S6_HUMAN		A paper showing involvement in Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 9 was retracted due to image duplication
FZR1_HUMAN		Originally thought to be phosphorylated by MPF during mitosis. However this paper was retracted due to falsification of data
ZN232_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-28 is the initiator. According to PubMed:11311944, strong Kozak for the downstream methionine
FZD1_HUMAN		Activation by specific Wnt family members may depend on the cells used for the experiment. Contradictory results have been reported for activation by WNT7B in human and mouse
SMC3_HUMAN		Was originally isolated as a proteoglycan protein (explaining its name). Although not excluded, such secreted function is not clear
NALDL_HUMAN		Was originally shown to have aminopeptidase IV activity (PubMed:10085079). Later characterization was unable to detect any significant aminopeptidase IV activity (PubMed:25752612)
AKT3_HUMAN		In light of strong homologies in the primary amino acid sequence, the 3 AKT kinases were long surmised to play redundant and overlapping roles. More recent studies has brought into question the redundancy within AKT kinase isoforms and instead pointed to isoform specific functions in different cellular events and diseases. AKT1 is more specifically involved in cellular survival pathways, by inhibiting apoptotic processes; whereas AKT2 is more specific for the insulin receptor signaling pathway. Moreover, while AKT1 and AKT2 are often implicated in many aspects of cellular transformation, the 2 isoforms act in a complementary opposing manner. The role of AKT3 is less clear, though it appears to be predominantly expressed in brain
TTLL3_HUMAN		TTLL3 and TTLL8 monoglycylase-mediated glycylation of tubulin was initially reported to play a role in ependymal motile ciliary maintenance (By similarity). However, contradictory results were later observed (By similarity)
ARI1_HUMAN		The RING-type 2 zinc finger was initially reported to only bind 1 zinc ion instead of 2 compared to classical RING-types (PubMed:15236971). But it was later shown that it is not the case and binds 2 zinc ions (PubMed:23707686, PubMed:24058416)
SP16H_HUMAN		Although related to the peptidase M24 family, this protein lacks conserved active site residues suggesting that it may lack peptidase activity
N6MT1_HUMAN		Was reported to have N(6)-adenine-specific DNA methyltransferase by mediating methylation of DNA on the 6th position of adenine (N(6)-methyladenosine) (PubMed:30017583). The existence of N(6)-methyladenosine on DNA is unclear in mammals (PubMed:32203414). According to a report, the majority of N(6)-methyladenosine in DNA originates from RNA catabolism via a nucleotide salvage pathway and is misincorporated by DNA polymerases, arguing against a role as epigenetic DNA mark in mammalian cells (PubMed:32203414). Moreover, subsequent studies could not confirm the role of N6AMT1 as a N(6)-adenine-specific DNA methyltransferase (PubMed:30392959, PubMed:31632689, PubMed:31636962)
CERT_HUMAN		Was originally reported to have a protein kinase activity and to phosphorylate on Ser and Thr residues the Goodpasture autoantigen (in vitro)
NOX1_HUMAN		An isoform named NOH-1S resulting from alternative splicing was first described as a voltage-gated proton channel that mediates the H(+) currents (PubMed:10615049). However later studies showed that this isoform was an artifact most likely due to a stable loop formation of the NOX1 mRNA (Ref.3)
RM42_HUMAN		Has also been found in a preparation of mitochondrial small ribosomal subunits. Was erroneously (PubMed:11279123, PubMed:11551941) assigned to be MRP-S32
RTL8C_HUMAN		There seem to be two proteins that can be transcribed from FAM127A, one with a C-terminal CAAX box (AC O15255) and a smaller protein (the sequence shown here) that seems to be encoded by a multicopy gene originating from a retrotransposon
GOG8B_HUMAN		A family of highly similar proteins (GOLGA8A, GOLGA8B, GOLGA8C, GOLGA8D, GOLGA8E, GOLGA8F, GOLGA8G) are encoded by a repeated region on chromosome 15q11-15q13. Our sequences are in agreement with HGNC nomenclature
TIAF1_HUMAN		Product of a dubious CDS prediction. The TIAF1 protein is coded in the 3'-UTR region of MYO18A. Does not seem to exist in orthologs
LV319_HUMAN		For an example of a full-length immunoglobulin lambda light chain see AC P0DOX8
HV459_HUMAN		For examples of full-length immunoglobulin heavy chains (of different isotypes) see AC P0DOX2, AC P0DOX3, AC P0DOX4, AC P0DOX5 and AC P0DOX6
OPSG2_HUMAN		Medium-wave-sensitive opsin genes vary in number among individuals and, together with a single red pigment gene, reside in a head-to-tail tandem array within the X chromosome. In the GRCh38 reference genome assembly, there are 3 genes in tandem coding for identical proteins AC P04001, AC P0DN77 and P0DN78
PM2P3_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene
ZN674_HUMAN		Although ZNF674 has been reported to be involved in X-linked intellectual disability (PubMed:16385466), its pathological role is questionable (PubMed:23871722)
PLPR5_HUMAN		Has most probably no lipid phosphatase activity (By similarity). Critical residues that support the reaction mechanism in active members of that protein family, including the residues of the active site acting respectively as proton donor and nucleophile, are not conserved
GPR33_HUMAN		The sequence shown in this entry differs from the translation of the reference genome assembly (GRCh38/hg38) due to a nonsense variant creating stop codon at position 140 in the reference genome
PA2GC_HUMAN		Ser-67 is present instead of the conserved His which is one of the active site residues. It is therefore expected that this protein lacks catalytic activity
PA2GC_HUMAN		The N-terminal region is predicted based on cross-species conservation and limited EST data. Exact gene structure in this region is unclear
CTSRE_HUMAN		In mouse, Slco6c1 is an additional auxiliary subunit of the CatSper complex. It is unclear if the related SLCO6A1 protein performs the same role in non-rodent species
EF1A3_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene
STYL2_HUMAN		Ser-225 is present instead of the conserved Cys which is expected to be an active site residue suggesting that this protein has lost its phosphatase activity
NB5R5_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-2 is the initiator
PLPR3_HUMAN		Has most probably no phospholipid phosphatase activity (By similarity). This is supported by the fact that the phosphatase sequence motifs as well as the His residue acting as a nucleophile in active phosphatases of the PA-phosphatase related phosphoesterase family are not conserved (By similarity)
ZN551_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-17 is the initiator
GOR_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene. N-terminally truncated compared to the protein-coding REXO1 gene. Originally thought to encode human GOR47-1, an antigenic epitope identified from the serum of virus infected chimpanzee (see AC P48778), which was apparently also expressed in human and used in ELISA tests to detect hepatitis C virus infection in patients. It turns out that the peptide identified in chimpanzee cannot be produced by human REXO1L1/GOR gene, due to a premature stop codon in the gene (PubMed:11472404) and therefore the basis of the tests remains unclear. However, the same authors provide evidence of the expression of a different N-terminal peptide from the human REXO1L1/GOR gene, the GOR1-125 antigen (PubMed:11472404)
O52L1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-16 is the initiator
OR1L6_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-37 is the initiator
EFMT1_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be an N(6)-adenine-specific DNA methyltransferase based on primary sequence and predicted secondary structure
TF3A_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 is the initiator. Based on the lack of an in-frame AUG codon, mammalian TFIIIA may be translated from this non-AUG initiation site, which has a good Kozak context and which is well conserved among mammals
ZN576_HUMAN		Overlaps in opposite strand with ZNF428
GGA2B_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene
CMAH_HUMAN		An Alu-mediated mutation of this gene occured in a common ancestor of Homo sapiens and Homo sapiens neanderthalis, approximately 2.1-2.2 million years ago, before brain expansion. It is generally accepted that the product of this gene, if any, is catalytically inactive as suggested by the absence of CMP-Neu5Gc sialic acid in human, while it is abundantly expressed at the surface of many cells in other vertebrates. The gene is however, significantly transcribed and the product described here might be expressed in vivo (PubMed:19890979). The putative protein is N-terminally truncated compared to orthologs and lacks a region probably essential to the CMP-N-acetylneuraminate monooxygenase activity
CLCA3_HUMAN		In contrast to other members of the family, this protein is much shorter and lacks the VWFA domain. Defined as a pseudogene by HGNC. PubMed:10095065 reports that it is expressed and glycosylated in mammalian cells
GRCR2_HUMAN		Although it shares high sequence similarity with GRXCR1, it does not contain a canonical glutaredoxin domain
SHSA7_HUMAN		SHISA7 has been reported to interact with AMPAR subunit GRIA1 in heterologous conditions and in the brain (By similarity). However, it was later demonstrated that SHISA7 does not colocalize neither interact with AMPAR, but with GABA(A)R (By similarity). Therefore additional experiments are needed to understand the discrepancy for SHISA7 function
SIG16_HUMAN		According to PubMed:18629938, the SIGLECP16 sequence, that was initially classified as a pseudogene, has a 4 bp deletion when compared with the sequence shown in this entry. This deletion is a polymorphism with a frequency of around 50% in the UK population. The frameshifted allele is non-functional whereas the sequence displayed here seems to be functional. The functional allele has been named SIGLEC16 in PubMed:18629938
AXA2L_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene. The existence of a transcript at this locus is supported by only one sequence submission (PubMed:2174397)
D11L8_HUMAN		Defined as a pseudogene by HGNC. However, proteomics data suggest the existence of the protein
TM262_HUMAN		In mouse, Slco6c1 is an additional auxiliary subunit of the CatSper complex. It is unclear if the related SLCO6A1 protein performs the same role in non-rodent species
PRKY_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene. Highly similar to PRKX in the pseudoautosomal region of the X chromosome, the transcripts specific of that gene are potential candidates for nonsense-mediated decay
NDK8_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene
FMO6_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene
LY6H_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-6 is the initiator

CMC4_HUMAN		MTCP1 and MTCP1NB are transcribed from the same promoter and could be considered the same gene
ENVT1_HUMAN		The cleavage site does not match the consensus
ENVT1_HUMAN		CKS-17 sequence does not match the minimal active consensus
LETM2_HUMAN		Despite its name, it does not contain any EF-hand domains
DB136_HUMAN		Was termed (Ref.2) DEFB137
KRBX4_HUMAN		Despite its name, it does not contain a canonical C2H2-type zinc-finger, seems to be a partial inverted duplication of ZNF674
PDPK2_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene
ARMC6_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-26 is the initiator
LCTL_HUMAN		Although it belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase 1 family, Asp-201 is present instead of the conserved Glu which is an active site residue. It is therefore expected that this protein lacks glycosidase activity
ZN550_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-10 is the initiator
OOSP2_HUMAN		Unlike human OOSP2, mouse OOSP2 seems not participate in folliculogenesis and oocyte maturation
KR131_HUMAN		The sequence of 1-41 of PubMed:12359730 has not been submitted
CCNJL_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-2 is the initiator
PPIL6_HUMAN		Despite the fact that it belongs to the cyclophilin-type PPIase family, a report has shown that it has probably no peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity
OR2C3_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-2 is the initiator
MYCT1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-49 is the initiator
GPT11_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-27 is the initiator

VEXIN_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-2 is the initiator
DDX12_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene
BORC8_HUMAN		The gene for this protein is either identical to or adjacent to that of MEF2B. Some mRNAs that encode this protein also include MEF2B
1A1L1_HUMAN		Similar to plant 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthases but lacks a number of residues which are necessary for activity
ZN577_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-8 is the initiator
MEGF9_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-9 is the initiator
O51M1_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-12 is the initiator
CZIB_HUMAN		Was identified as interaction partner for CCS (PubMed:30260988). Only misfolded mutant protein forms that lack part of the zinc-binding sites interact with CCS. The full-length protein does not interact with CCS. Likewise, mutant protein that lacks all four zinc-binding residues does not interact with CCS (PubMed:30260988)
FXL21_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene. The reference genome assembly (GRCh38/hg38) corresponds to a non-functional allele with a stop codon at position 56 suggesting that this gene may be a pseudogene, at least in some part of the population. The existence of a functional transcript at this locus is supported by only one sequence submission
ZFP37_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-34 is the initiator. Orthologous sequences start at a downstream Met
A3LT2_HUMAN		According to a report, the spliced A3GALT2 mRNA is not detected in human tissues (PubMed:18630988). The functional activity of human A3GALT2 tested by expressing a chimeric protein containing the catalytic domain of human A3GALT2 is unable to synthesize isogloboside 3 (iGb3). Futhermore mutagenesis experiments in rat, show that the mutant 'Asn-253' of human A3GALT2 completely eliminates alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase activity (PubMed:18630988)
SACA6_HUMAN		Was originally thought to be a non protein-coding gene
U17L3_HUMAN		The RS447 megasatellite DNA is a highly polymorphic conserved tandem repetitive sequence which contains a copy of the USP17 gene. It is present with an interindividual variation in copy number, ranging from 20 to 103, and can be found in the genome both on chromosome 4 and chromosome 8. The high similarity between the UPS17-like genes makes impossible to clearly assign data to one of the genes of the family. Oligonucleotides designed in RNAi experiments are for instance not specific of a given UPS17-like gene
ENO4_HUMAN		Although it belongs to the enolase family, Leu-362 is present instead of the conserved Glu which is expected to be an active site residue
GOG8A_HUMAN		A family of highly similar proteins (GOLGA8A, GOLGA8B, GOLGA8C, GOLGA8D, GOLGA8E, GOLGA8F, GOLGA8G) are encoded by a repeated region on chromosome 15q11-15q13. Our sequences are in agreement with HGNC nomenclature

RHF2B_HUMAN		RHOF2 and RHOF2B are arranged in a head-to-head orientation and share high sequence similarity (>99%). They cannot easily be distinguished and are usually analyzed as a single gene
IGLC6_HUMAN		For an example of a full-length immunoglobulin lambda light chain see AC P0DOX8
OPSG3_HUMAN		Medium-wave-sensitive opsin genes vary in number among individuals and, together with a single red pigment gene, reside in a head-to-tail tandem array within the X chromosome. In the GRCh38 reference genome assembly, there are 3 genes in tandem coding for identical proteins AC P04001, AC P0DN77 and P0DN78
IGD_HUMAN		This sequence is an example of a full-length immunoglobulin delta heavy chain
IGG1_HUMAN		This sequence is an example of a full-length immunoglobulin gamma-1 heavy chain
IGM_HUMAN		This sequence is an example of a full-length immunoglobulin mu heavy chain
DVLP1_HUMAN		Product of a dubious gene prediction. Pizzuti et al (PubMed:8644734) identified this gene on chromosome 22, however it is not currently present in the reference genome assembly (GRCh37/hg19)
MTCP1_HUMAN		MTCP1 and MTCP1NB are transcribed from the same promoter and could be considered the same gene
EFC2_HUMAN		The cleavage site does not match the consensus

EST5A_HUMAN		Was termed (Ref.1) CES5
PRS42_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene
CLCL1_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene
ZN615_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-2 is the initiator
OR6K3_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1, Met-5 or Met-17 is the initiator
GNRR2_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene. A frameshift introducing a premature stop codon in exon 1 most probably results in the inactivation of that transcribed gene in human. However, alternative splicing may allow the production of a truncated but possibly functional protein containing 5 transmembrane domains which is shown here
PEBP4_HUMAN		It was previously reported that PEBP4 is a lysosomal protein which is highly expressed in tumor cells, and may promote cellular resistance to TNF-induced apoptosis. However the paper has since been retracted by the journal due to concerns of image manipulation
SMPX_HUMAN		It is uncertain whether Met-1 or Met-3 is the initiator
VPK6_HUMAN		Pro proteins of ERVK-6 tandem proviruses have been initially reported as being identical (AAF88166 and AAD21096). However, the same Pro proteins sequences, when translated from the human genome draft (AC072054), show one conflict with respect to each other
WASH4_HUMAN		The WASH4P N-terminus differs from WASH3P for which it is shown to be required for the WASH complex assembly. Hence is association within the WASH complex is ambiguous. However, WASH4P retains the regions implicated in interaction with WASHC2 and conferring in vitro NPF activity
WASH4_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene
SO1B7_HUMAN		Product of a dubious CDS prediction. May encode a non-functional truncated protein
MFS11_HUMAN		Despite its name, it is related to the unc-93 family and not to the major facilitator superfamily

Both mitochondrial ribosome 28S subunit and OGDC have a similar size and OGDC is highly abundant, therefore OGDC has been found to contaminate ribosomal preparations performed by sequential centrifugation steps (By similarity). In addition, KGD4 could not be located in the structure of the human mitochondrial ribosome, supporting the hypothesis that it is not a mitoribosomal protein (PubMed:25838379)

GGTA1_HUMAN		Could be the product of a pseudogene. According to PubMed:12499400, the human GGTA1 gene is an expressed pseudogene encoding non-functional truncated proteins containing the first four translated exons but missing the two catalytic exons. Although all exons expected to encode a functional GGTA1 of 371 residues are present in the human genome, all transcripts described encode truncated proteins that result from prematurely terminated transcription at the level of a strong transcriptional stop signal in the middle of intron 7. The premature transcriptional arrest of human GGTA1 gene leads to an ectopic splicing event and to the connection of a short intronic sequence downstream from translated exons. GGTA1 is active in marsupials, nonprimate placental mammals, lemurs and New World monkeys and synthesizes a carbohydrate antigen called 'alpha-gal epitope'. The alpha-gal epitope is present in large numbers on cell membrane glycolipids and glycoproteins. GGTA1 gene was inactivated in ancestral Old World monkeys and apes and, because of this, they lack alpha-gal epitopes and naturally produce an antibody called the 'anti-Gal antibody' which binds specifically to alpha-gal epitopes, is the most abundant antibody in humans and is responsible of rejection of mammalian xenografts
